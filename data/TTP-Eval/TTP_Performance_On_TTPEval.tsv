In News, Uncategorized by Justin Welton May 25, 2016. As contradictory as it may seem, to help with overall alkalinity there is at least one place in the body where we want that acid: the stomach. While too much acid causes indigestion, heartburn and reflux disease, too little causes maldigestion and a host of other issues. Excess acid has received much of the attention so far, with as many as 4 in 10 Americans having symptoms of heartburn and gastrointestinal esophageal reflux disease (GERD).. There is a surfeit of medications formulated towards just this one function: reduction of acid in the stomach, and act in the following main ways:. – By neutralizing the acid like Tums, Maalox. – Slowing down acid production or blocking the histamine 2 receptor like Zantac and Tagamet. – Blocking acid at the subcellular level as Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) do.. PPIs are among the highest-selling classes of drugs in the U.S., earning $9.5 billion in sales in 2012 and over a 100 million prescriptions written. With the multitude of people hooked on these medications, negative associations with regular use of these drugs have been mounting. PPIs are linked with cognitive decline based on the fact that they increase the levels of β-amyloid in the brain. A recent study published in JAMA Neurology showed 44 percent increased risk of dementia in elderly people over 75 years who took PPIs regularly -women were the hardest hit. PPIs inhibit the production and secretion of hydrochloric acid in the stomach-an important mediator of calcium absorption in the small intestine. This leads to decrease in bone mineral density and increased risk of bone fractures.. More Problems With Low Stomach Acid. Low acid production is often the cause of many chronic problems for people in their 40’s and 50’s and nowadays for younger people as well. Lowering acid in the stomach is unhealthy and unnatural; here’s why:. Increased bacterial overgrowth. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) was seen in 50% of people using PPIs as reported in a 2010 Italian study. PPIs — one of the most commonly prescribed heartburn and GERD medication, are often prescribed without clear indications and have shown to increase risk of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) leading to diarrhea and associated digestive problems.. Impaired nutrient absorption —> decreased resistance to infection. As acid declines and the pH of the stomach increases, absorption of nutrients becomes impaired. Decades of research have confirmed that low stomach acid – whether it occurs on its own or as a result of using antacid drugs – reduces absorption of several key nutrients such as iron, B12, folate, calcium and zinc.. Increased risk of cancer and other diseases. By increasing the pH of the stomach, PPIs	None	None	None	None	None		"<|im_sep|><Reasoning>

Terms and Conditions. Kodak Black Responds to SteveWillDoIt Over Alleged Richard Mille Theft. By Sophie / June 17, 2024. News. Kodak Black Responds to SteveWillDoIt Over Alleged Richard Mille Theft. Kodak Black has found himself in the middle of a heated controversy with YouTuber SteveWillDoIt, following accusations of an attempted theft involving a $500,000 Richard Mille watch. The drama unfolded when SteveWillDoIt took to Twitter, now rebranded as X, to claim that the rapper tried to rob him.. In a series of now-deleted tweets, SteveWillDoIt questioned the financial status of rappers, stating, “Do rappers make money? Kodak Black just tried to rob me for my Richard Mille. Is every rapper broke? The guy smokes meth, probably insane. Kodak Black is 100% on drugs.”. Kodak Black, visibly upset, responded during an Instagram Live session. “That’s why I hate drunk stuff. I hate drunk stuff. People always get beside themselves. That’s why I don’t drink liquor no more,” he said. Addressing SteveWillDoIt directly, Kodak added, “Why are you being prejudiced, sir? Have you seen me do any drugs? You made a tweet to the whole world like I wasn’t finna get on the internet and say, ‘Oh, SteveWillDoIt is a b****.’ I told you to your face and I threw your stuff on the floor.”. The incident, which reportedly occurred without any additional witnesses, remains shrouded in uncertainty. However, Kodak Black appears to be taking the accusations seriously enough to threaten SteveWillDoIt with physical harm. “I don’t give a [expletive] about none of them muscles or that tight ass suit you was wearing yesterday,” Kodak fired back. “I told you to your [expletive] face. A n**** will knock your drunk ass out.”. The back-and-forth has drawn significant attention online, with fans and followers weighing in on the dispute. While some support SteveWillDoIt’s version of events, others find it implausible that Kodak, who reportedly owns multiple high-end watches, would attempt such a theft.. This feud comes on the heels of Kodak Black’s recent collaboration with Don Toliver for their new single, “BROTHER STONE.” The two artists shared a music video for the song on Saturday afternoon, adding another layer of complexity to Kodak’s current public image.. As the situation continues to unfold, it remains to be seen whether the two will resolve their differences or if the feud will escalate further. For now, the online community remains divided, with both Kodak Black and SteveWillDoIt standing firm in their respective positions.. Related Posts.

Bob Menendez appears to be the focus of a criminal investigation that also resulted in a raid last month against an eye doctor accused of lavishing the Democrat with gifts and young prostitutes, two bureau sources told the Daily Caller.. The Caller wrote that the FBI’s inquiry has changed focus to New Jersey from Miami, where the doctor is based, suggesting Menendez is the ultimate target.. Menendez has forcefully denied any involvement with prostitutes of any age, though he recently reimbursed Melgen $58,500 for two private jet trips to the Dominican Republican in 2010.. The probe began in Miami.. Menendez has adamantly denied any wrongdoing.. Share on Facebook. Tweet. Tagged: Bob Menendez FBI Miami New Jewsey senator. Post navigation.

In fact politics play a huge role in DOJ. The US Attorney is appointed by the President the Attorney General, again appointed by the president. The Director of the FBI, well he got a 2 year extension on his career and again, is appointed by the president. DOJ is corrupt. Plain and simple. Decisions are clearly politically motivated. Not by the agents who are working the case putting in 14 hours a day to do the right thing, but by DOJ main justice and the US Attorney’s Office they are working with.

As I sat on the bench close to my sister, I could hear Ngozi scream. Her voice almost pierced the sky. My mother was also crying with her. It was as if she was the one who was being cut and not her innocent three-month-old baby. Nneka, too, was scared. She clung to me tight while I covered her ears with both hands. I didn't mind my ears getting bled from the woes of that day; I guess my sister needed hers more than I did.. Throughout that day, my mother sat close to the baby, crying. She was looking at our baby sister and raining all kinds of insult on my father's extended family.. "This is our tradition, Nnenna. You know that very well," my father said, in a way trying to pacify my mother.. "This is wickedness! No girl should go through this! No girl!" My mother sounded defiant.. "Ogini? What about boys? Don't they get circumcised, too?" he fired back.. That woke up Ngozi who resumed her sobbing. My mother picked her up, placed her on her chest and began to dance to a silent rhythm.. "Ozugo!" was what my father said that made our baby come to a decrescendo. Maybe Ngozi understood Igbo, or she needed to give our parents space to discuss.. "Look at our poor baby. And I begged you, Okafor. I told you it wasn't necessary, but you allowed those wicked people cut my baby. Our baby!" my mother teared up. She began to sob heavily, cleaning her snot with the edge of her wrapper.. "Nnenna, why are you doing like this nau? You, of all people, know it is what tradition demands. There was nothing I could have done. It is what our forefathers have been doing. We can't change it." He paused, then continued, "Our elders say that 'what the old men can see while seating, the young ones cannot see it even if they climb a tree.' To you, it might look like a terrible thing; but to us, it is the right thing. The best thing we can do to help protect our girls. We don't want them to be promiscuous. Look at Ezinne, Chidi's daughter. She is prostituting herself upandan because she was never circumcised. Tell me, will a circumcised girl do like that?" He expected my mother to answer, but she hissed in disgust. My father didn't mind her, but carried on with his sermon.. "Look at Adaobi," he pointed at me. "Isn't she a good girl? Very decent girl. Pure virgin!" he said 'girl' like 'gal' and 'virgin' like 'varjeen.' "Since she got circumcised, she has kept herself, not allowing any man to touch her. She's saving herself for marriage. You should be grateful that our daughter, at sixteen, is still keeping her legs closed. So many girls, that are not even up to her age, have already been disvarjeend! I know my daughter will make me proud," he said complacently, grinning from ear to ear.. Only if my father knew how Okeke, my older cousin, always sneaked into our compound most nights to put his thing into mine, savouring me with so much pleasure. Painful pleasure. Okeke said it would help me to become a big girl, and that I would enjoy sex better when I got married.. WHAT TRADITION DEMANDS. Readersketch | Ed. Kawthar A. Omisore. © Bianca Ihua.

The text is a story about a family dealing with the tradition of circumcision. The story describes the emotional and physical pain experienced by the family members, especially the mother and the baby. The text also touches upon the cultural and traditional beliefs that justify the practice of circumcision.

The text reports an incident of circumcision, which is a form of sexual abuse and violence. The text does not promote or justify the act but rather shows the emotional turmoil and pain caused by it. This makes the content fall under ""Topical-v"" for Sexual content as it reports an incident of sexual abuse without promoting it.

The text also touches upon the cultural and traditional beliefs that justify the practice of circumcision, which can be seen as a form of ideological harm.

The text talks about a claim that 86% of children suffered an adverse reaction in the Pfizer trials. This is a misinformation related to health, as it tries to propagate a false claim without any scientific evidence.
As per the section (c.ii), ""Misinformation"" falls in the section of Ideological Harm. Hence, the label for ""Ideological Harm"" should be ""Intent-ii"".
The text has no mention of ANY Hate, Violence, Sexual Content, Illegal content or Self-Inflicted content. Hence their labels are ""None"".

BY ASSOCIATED PRESS. CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) — Hundreds of students in graduation robes walked out of the Harvard commencement on Thursday chanting “Free, free Palestine” after weeks of protests on campus and a day after the school announced that 13 Harvard students who participated in a protest encampment would not be able to receive diplomas alongside their classmates.. Some students chanted “Let them walk, let them walk” during Thursday’s commencement, referring to allowing those 13 students to get their diplomas along with fellow graduates.. Student speaker Shruthi Kumar said “this semester our freedom of speech and our expressions of solidarity became punishable,” she said to cheers and applause.. She said she had to recognize “the 13 undergraduates in the class of 2024 who will not graduate today,” generating prolonged cheers and clapping from graduates. “I am deeply disappointed by the intolerance for freedom of speech and the right to civil disobedience on campus.”. Over 1,500 students had petitioned, and nearly 500 staff and faculty had spoken up, all over the sanctions, she said.. “This is about civil rights and upholding democratic principles,” she said. “The students had spoken. The faculty had spoken. Harvard do you hear us?”. Those in the encampment had called for a ceasefire in Gaza and for Harvard to divest from companies that support the war.. Commencement speaker Maria Ressa, a journalist and advocate for freedom of the press, told the graduates that “you don’t know who you are until you’re tested, until you fight for what you believe in. Because that defines who you are.”. “The campus protests are testing everyone in America. Protests are healthy. They shouldn’t be violent. They shouldn’t be silenced,” she said.. Asmer Asrar Safi was one of the 13 students blocked from receiving a diploma Thursday. The penalty shows how far the school will go to silence voices that challenge their donor base, he said.. “While we will not be returning to this school, we hope that our friends carry the liberatory legacy of the Gaza solidarity encampment alive, and strive even harder for divestment,” he said in a written statement.. Alaha Nasari, who graduated with a degree in the history of science and global health, said she and other students opted to walk out of the ceremonies when interim President Alan Garber took to the stage.. “I think that the lack of faculty support has been one of the most disheartening aspects of being a student protester,” she said.. Also on Thursday, the presidents of Northwestern and Rutgers universities defended their decisions to end pro-Palestinian encampments through negotiations rather than police force, telling the House Committee on Education and the Workforce that they defused the danger on their campuses without ceding ground to protesters. The hearing was part of a series examining how colleges have responded to allegations of antisemitism.. The decision by Harvard’s top governing board follows a recommendation Monday by faculty members to allow the 13 to receive their degrees despite their participation in the encampment.. However, Harvard’s governing board said that each of the 13 were found to have violated the university’s policies by their conduct during the encampment protest.. “In coming to this determination, we note that the express provisions of the Harvard College Student Handbook state that students who are not in good standing are not eligible for degrees,” the Harvard Corporation said in a written statement.. The statement left open the possibility of an appeals process.. Supporters of the students at Harvard said the decision not to allow them to receive degrees at commencement violated a May 14 agreement between Garber and the Harvard Out of Occupied Palestine coalition that would have allowed the students to graduate..

Originally posted by Herlock Sholmes View Post. neither George or Fishy have taken the time or effort to read Bugliosi’s 1600 page analysis of the case (including something like 2000 pages of endnotes and sources.) And why? Because these monumental piece of work is just speculation, surmise and supposition and short on scientific explanation according to someone that hasn’t bothered to read it!. Unavoidable conclusion - that at the very least Oswald took the rifle into work.. Did he fire it? A paraffin test said that he’d fired a gun.. Then this innocent man scarpered, straight past his bus stop, got on the wrong bus, jumped off into a taxi then got dropped 4 blocks from his rooming house but walked back.. I watched the YouTube video of Bugliosi promoting his book. Pontifications about keeping secrets, then "there's no evidence that Oswald had any connection of association with any of these groups" (see below), "assuming for the state of argument", "Oswald would have been one of the last people of earth the CIA would have gone to, why, he was not an expert shot, he was a good shot but not an expert shot" (seems to be arguing against Oswald being capable), "he had a $12 mail order rifle" (fact check please), "just the type of guy that the CIA would rely on to commit the biggest murder in history" (sarcastic remark but a good argument for why Oswald wasn't a trigger man). Then there's a bunch of speculation about "likelihoods" of how Oswald might have been disposed of, "does any rational person believe". Enough is enough. I'll add pontifications to speculation, surmise and supposition. And it is suggested that I devote hours to reading more of this outdated nonsense?. "at the very least Oswald took the rifle into work". Doesn't prove he fired it or that he acted alone. I'm not disputing that he was involved in some way.. The paraffin test showed residue on his hands, as it would if he fired a revolver, not on his face which would have been right next to the bolt mechanism on a rifle.. If Oswald twigged he was being set up he would have made some evasive moves.. And now, the smoking gun document, recently released, from the head of the CIA to the head of the Secret Service stating that "Oswald subject was trained by this agency under the cover of the office of Naval Intelligence, for Soviet assignments." This is from Groden's new book, "JFK: Absolute Proof" which contains 1000 photos, some of which have not previously been seen, and the latest released documents. IMO a far better buy and read than the outdated ramblings of a dinosaur.. It's sad that governments are chiefed by the double tongues.

Anti-U.N. residents plan protest during peace garden dedication Sunday. By Howard B. Owens. May 5, 2012, 12:15am. This page is only available to Early Access supporters. Sign up to get access.. The dedication of the peace garden in Batavia on Sunday will draw a quiet protest from some local residents, according to Mike Barrett, owner of Barrett's Batavia Marine.. The problem, Barrett said, is that the peace garden is a little too closely linked with the United Nations and Barrett and others are no fan of the U.N.. One of Barrett's current concerns is a U.N. push to create an international treaty on the trade of guns, and while supporters of the treaty say it merely deals with the illicit sale of guns, groups such as the NRA fear it's really an attempt to circumvent the 2nd Amendment (Wikipedia).. "(The peace garden is) a noble effort," Barrett said, "but when one of the principles of the peace garden gets an award from the United Nations and they're going to have a torch run via the U.N. from Buffalo to Albany, that concerns us. We don't want anything to do with the U.N.". Barrett is referring to Paula Savage, a Batavia native who organized the first peace garden in Ottawa and is now part of the International Peace Garden Foundation.. Savage was recently honored by the U.N. for her peace garden efforts.. The Batavia garden is adjacent to the Holland Land Office Museum on West Main Street and the protest is scheduled to start at 2 p.m. on the opposite side of the street.. "It will be peaceful. There will be no bullhorns," Barrett said. "We're going to have an informational protest to show that the the peace garden is associated with the United Nations and that we're dead set against what the U.N. does.". batavia. Peace Garden. Paula Ferraro. Really? Staging an. Really? Staging an informational protest at a Peace Garden dedication because the woman who started it was honored by the UN which MIGHT create an international treaty that COULD be an attempt to circumvent the 2nd amendment?

Volunteer. ABC Illawarra Interview on Ice Treatment Cuts Hurting the Illawarra. 20 October 2015. MELINDA JAMES:Lets hear from Stephen Jones, the Oppositions assistant spokesperson on health. He has had a lot to say about ice and federal government funding for various treatment programs. He spoke earlier today to Nick McLaren.. STEPHEN JONES, SHADOW ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH:The situation in the Illawarra, in the Shoalhaven, in the Southern Highlands, in fact right around the country, is exactly the same.. There are more people trying to turn their lives around, to rehabilitate themselves, than there are services available. In fact, on the weekend I was in Alice Springs and they said that the two services out there could take three times as many people, they are having to turn people away on a daily basis. The week before that I was in Nowra, its the same story. They are turning people away because they dont have the services available. In Wollongong they also dont have the services available. The Government has to step up to the plate; theyve had a National Ice Taskforce and spent $20 million on an advertising campaign telling us that we have a problem. But they wont put resources into the real solution to the problem which is rehabilitation.. NICK MCLAREN: But surely the National Ice Taskforce has identified that there is a shortage of services and that something needs to be done about that?. JONES: In fact the head of the Taskforce, Ken Lay, has said that we cant arrest our way out of this problem and that we need to look to other strategies such as rehabilitation and prevention. Yet we had the Minister stand up in Parliament yesterday and disavow these findings and say that they are going to take a different direction. This is very disappointing, we need the Government to release the Taskforce report and respond to it in a proper way.. MCLAREN: So the report hasnt been released yet?. JONES: The report hasnt been released yet, they have been sitting on it for a while now. We need the Government to release the report and have a public discussion about strategies that are going to work.. MCLAREN: Just finally, is this one of these federal/state things where the federal Government says that it is a state responsibility?. JONES: For over twenty years both the federal and state governments have had a role in rehabilitation. Its proceeded this way under successive governments and most treatment services would fall over if there wasnt federal Government funding going into them. All tiers of government have a role to play.. Volunteer. Contact Privacy Policy. Authorised by Stephen Jones MP, ALP, Shop 244 Stockland Shellharbour, Shellharbour NSW 2529. .

HPV transmission via oral sex practices suggests research. Download PDF Copy. By Dr. Ananya Mandal, MDJan 29 2012. A new study suggested that an estimated 7% of American teens and adults carry the human papillomavirus in their mouths. This may help health experts finally understand why rates of mouth and throat cancer have been climbing for nearly 25 years. The evidence additionally makes it clear that oral sex practices play a key role in transmission.. This was reported online Thursday by the Journal of the American Medical Assn. and is the first to assess the prevalence of oral HPV infection in the U.S. population. The findings indicate that the virus is not likely to spread through kissing or casual contact and that most cases of oral HPV can be traced to oral sex.. “There is a strong association for sexual behavior, and that has important implications for public health officials who teach sexual education,” said Dr. Maura L. Gillison of the Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, who led the study and presented the findings Thursday at a meeting of head and neck cancer researchers and doctors in Phoenix.. Experts say that although herpes, HIV and other diseases can be transmitted via oral sex, the practice is often considered a safer alternative to sexual intercourse. A survey released last year by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that about 90% of adults have had oral sex, along with 27% of 15-year-old boys and 23% of 15-year-old girls.. “I don't think people think of oral sex in the same way they do with traditional intercourse,” said Fred Wyand, director of the HPV Resource Center at the American Social Health Assn. in Research Triangle Park, N.C. “Sometimes younger people engage in oral sex so they don't have to worry about pregnancy. They may not even make the link between oral sex and STDs.”. However the link between oral cancers and transmission of HPV to the mouth has been mounting over the last decade. Initial studies found that patients with oral cancer were far more likely than healthy controls to have engaged in oral sex. And a 2007 study in the New England Journal of Medicine found that the more oral sex partners a person has had, the greater their risk of developing throat cancer.. HPV is best known as the cause of cervical cancer, which kills 4,220 women in the U.S. each year, according to the National Cancer Institute. The virus can also cause vulvar, anal, penile and various head and neck cancers. A study published in October in the Journal of Clinical Oncology traced more than 70% of new cases of oral cancers to HPV infection, putting it ahead of tobacco use as the leading cause of such cancers.. Most oral HPV infections are harmless, and oral cancers are still relatively uncommon. But given the new information, doctors should encourage their patients to use protection during oral sex, Dr. Hans Schlecht, assistant professor of medicine at Drexel University College of Medicine in Philadelphia, wrote in an editorial accompanying the study. “It's something people are not comfortable talking about, but it is protective,” he said in an interview. “If you are going to be intimate with someone, there are some adult conversations you need to have.”. HPV infection is common — an estimated 80% of Americans have contracted the virus, Gillison said. It usually produces no symptoms and is typically cleared from the body through natural processes.

Hello, fellow willing meat! Please enjoy my fantasy! I have rewritten to make it more interesting, to make it more satisfying, to make me more satisfying, to flesh it out for me, to flesh me out for you, to make it tastier for me and you, and to make me tastier for you! Enjoy!. I want to be your meat. Please. However, before you cook me and eat me, something that I look forward to, I must ask: How would you like me to prepare myself to become your ideal main ingredient, your ideal meat, your ideal meal? Do you have any requirements for me? Any specifications as to diet and exercise? As to muscle size and composition? How much fat do you want me to have? How lean do you want me to be? Do you want my muscles to be solid, something that you can sink your teeth into, which is what I desperately want you to do? Or do you want my muscles to be flabby and easier to chew after you have cooked me, which I would accept if that is what you want? I eagerly await your pre-cooking instructions for me. I want to be just as you want me to be. After all, you are the chef and the cannibal, you are my hero for helping me with my fantasy. I am only the meat for you to cook and eat, only the humble, willing, and waiting main course for your special meat meal. You are in command and control of me, and I will obey your orders.. You are also in command and control of the process that you require me to follow before I am worthy of becoming your meat. You get to dictate how I must prepare myself for you, for your kitchen, for your oven, for your plate, for your table, for your knife and fork, and for your eagerly waiting mouth, teeth, and stomach aching for their special meal of my meat, for your special meat meal.. After I have prepared myself according to your strict, demanding instructions to become what you want me to be before you cook me and eat me, I must ask: what recipe you will use when you cook me? You can cook me any way you want, of course, but I'd like to know in advance. Will you cook me whole? Will you butcher me and cook me in pieces? If you butcher me, will you save some of my meat to cook and eat later, or will you cook me all at one time? Will you execute me before you cook me or butcher me? Will you add vegetables, potatoes, rice, other grains, salt, spices, herbs to the pot or the pan that you cook me in? Will I smell good while you are cooking me? Will I smell good when you have finished cooking me? Will your mouth water in anticipation of eating me? Please describe the sights, the sounds, the smells, the feelings that you have when you cook me and eat me? Please describe what you want me to see, hear, smell, and feel when you cook me and eat me.. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFOUWoZ-ic0. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhAqmXjKWa0.

Or do you have other plans for me?. After you have cooked me, you can eat me however you want, of course, but I'd like to know in advance. Is there a special manner in which you want to eat me, to eat my meat? I have no say in the matter. I am your humble servant willing and aching to be your meat before you cook me, and I am your willing and aching to be your honorable serving of meat after you have cooked me, and you eat me.

By Adam Kovac January 30, 2023. Roughly 100 schools, congregations and Jewish organizations have signed an open letter to Elon Musk denouncing antisemitism on Twitter. Numerous racists and bigots who had been banned from the social media platform have been reinstated since Musk took over.. The letter was first published on the Union for Reform Judaism website several weeks ago. Monday marked its official release and unveiling of the signees.

While most organizations are based in the U.S., the Reform Jewish Community of Canada has also signed on..

The diversity of the groups illustrates the widespread concern over the explosion of hate on Twitter since Musk’s purchase in October, said Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism associate director Barbara Weinstein. The letter will be sent to Musk directly as well as circulated on social media.. Weinstein said the link between the dissemination of online hate and real-world violence is undeniable. Antisemitic crimes have spiked in recent years, including several acts of violence in synagogues. On Sunday, a molotov cocktail was thrown through the window of a New Jersey Reform congregation.. “We’ve had some internal conversations about what we could do to draw attention to the issue and even though we could have done something just as the URJ, or the Reform Movement, we thought it would be more powerful and impactful if we did something that spoke with the strength of the organized Jewish community,” she said.. Under Musk’s leadership, many prominent neo-Nazis, anti-Jewish conspiracy theorists and other prominent bigots have had their accounts, which often have tens or hundreds of thousands of followers, restored. Some have been suspended again after immediately reengaging in hate speech.. Musk has described himself as a “free speech absolutist,” but he has also reportedly told investors he does not want Twitter to devolve into a “hellscape.” The URJ’s letter points out that Musk himself has tweeted out problematic content, including images of a Nazi soldier and memes involving Pepe the Frog, a popular alt-right mascot.. Weinstein said the hope is that the letter will raise awareness and let both Musk and policymakers know “that we are watching, that we’re not going to be silenced” and that Jews will not “stand idly by as this platform is used to spread hate and antisemitism with potentially devastating consequences for our community..

Antigua and United States Talks Deadlocked. By: R Kingsley, Thursday July 24th 2008. 0 Comments Email Print. The talks between the small island of Antigua and the United States have reached an impasse. The talks revolve around online gambling. Specifically they concern America's refusal to comply with a World Trade Organization ruling that affirms Antigua's right to provide online gambling services to American residents. America has imposed such severe financial constraints under the UIGEA that it has become almost impossible for Americans to transfer funds to offshore online casinos.. The WTO had awarded a $21 million order towards loss of business as a result of America's stance. The United States first appealed, then withdrew its appeal and finally withdrew from that section of the WTO agreement. This gave two options to Antigua. One was to begin production of goods otherwise protected by US intellectual property rights. This was not a course that Antigua wanted to follow. The other was to renegotiate the terms of the WTO judgment. It was with this intent that talks were being held. Antigua had several times pushed back the deadline given by the WTO for the resolution of the dispute. Antigua's Minister of Finance, Errol Cort, had gone on record stating that he hoped the issue would be resolved this time. A six-member American team under the leadership of US Trade Representative John K. Veroneau went to Antigua. Antigua was represented by Errol Cort, Dr. John Ashe Antigua's ambassador to the WTO, and other officials. However all the optimism proved misplaced. America refused to budge and the situation remains unchanged. The only thing that was agreed upon by the two sides was a new deadline of August 1. Everyone knows that this deadline is meaningless. Some reports suggest that any movement would take at least three months. Others suggest that with the coming Presidential elections in America, the Bush administration will not act but pass the buck to the new President. Some are even suggesting that America does not intent to do anything at all.. The only ray of hope for Antigua comes from the European Union taking on the American might against the latter's stand on online gambling. European online casinos also have suffered since the forced withdrawal of American players. In June the EU contacted the relevant American authorities and informed them that they viewed the UIGEA as discriminatory and sought an explanation from them. The response came from the U.S. Trade Representative's office in the form of a single line terse statement, which said that there was no basis for any allegation of discrimination in the enforcement of US gambling laws. Now a meeting has been fixed between the concerned representatives of the EU and the U.S. officials to discuss the issue. Doubtless the EU will be a more difficult party to handle than Antigua was..

ByMikeM January 16, 2016 December 20, 2020 Reading Time: 1 minute. “When researchers asked what did provide comfort to someone who was estranged from a close family member, people said “having someone listen” to them, “being seen as normal,” having someone telling them that they were “an okay person,” and hearing that others had similar experiences all eased the pains. But the strong underlying message is that the complexity of parents and their adult children deserves greater prominence.”. This article isn’t specifically about child abuse, but I know a lot of survivors are facing this reality. They are estranged from their family, and that is difficult, even when it’s clearly the right thing to do. It can be the healthiest thing for you, but doesn’t mean you don’t get to mourn what you don’t have within your family. Not having a family to spend the holidays with, or share childhood memories with, sucks. Nothing can replace that, but we can certainly find our own group of supporters who can become our “family”..

Intelligence officials warn Russia is a 'preeminent threat' to US elections. The country is working to promote divisive narratives and denigrate specific politicians, officials said.. Prev Next. Russia is working to promote divisive narratives and denigrate specific politicians, U.S. intelligence officials said. (Scripps News). By: Liz Landers , Cameron Couvillion. Posted at 5:07 PM, Jul 09, 2024. Intelligence officials are warning that Russia remains a “preeminent threat” in terms of foreign influence on U.S. elections, noting that they are beginning to see Russia target specific types of voters. In addition to Russia, U.S. officials are also watching Iran and China, which are part of the intelligence community’s “big three” in foreign election influence activity.. “Russia is undertaking a whole-of-government approach to influence the election, including the presidential race, Congress and public opinion,” an official from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence told reporters in a briefing call held on Tuesday.. “Iran is a chaos agent and China is holding fire on the presidential race,” the official added.. RELATED STORY | US agency fighting Russian, Chinese disinformation may lose funding. In an effort toward transparency as the 2024 presidential election approaches, officials from the Office of Director of National Intelligence, the FBI, and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency vowed to continue to brief reporters and share information publicly about the election threat landscape as key dates in the 2024 presidential race approach.. Senator Mark Warner, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, praised the intelligence community’s efforts toward public updates, adding in a statement that he encourages Americans “to stay informed and alert.". "Social media, in particular, continues to be a popular vector for foreign covert influence attempts, and our adversaries remain focused on stoking social, racial, and political tensions among Americans," Warner stated.. RELATED STORY | Could your vote be swayed by artificial intelligence this November?. In addition to Russia’s activities targeting specific voter demographics, an ODNI official said the country is also working to promote divisive narratives and denigrate specific politicians. The goal for Moscow, according to the official, is to "shape electoral outcomes, undermine electoral integrity and amplify domestic divisions.”. The official reiterated several times that the intelligence community has not observed a shift in Russia’s preferences for the presidential race from past elections.. The ODNI official also stressed that the agency has not observed any plans or seen any efforts to degrade or disrupt the U.S.'s ability to hold an election.. However, officials pointed to artificial intelligence as an accelerant of malicious activities. One ODNI official revealed that Russia is implementing AI to target specific U.S. regions, using the technology to create voice messages spoken with a Southern or Midwestern accent.. RELATED STORY | The war on misinformation in modern wartime. The warning from the intelligence community comes on the same day that the Justice Department announced that it had seized domain names and more than 900 social media accounts used by Russians to spread disinformation in the U.S. In conjunction with the FBI and international agencies, they uncovered a Russian bot farm that they say was created by the state-run RT news network alongside the Russian security agency FSB, which used X to spread pro-Russian government messages..

Acute Malnutrition On Steady Rise in Somaliland Amid Aid Delays. By. Somtribune Staff Writer. -. September 4, 2017. 0. 409. Facebook. Twitter. Pinterest. WhatsApp. PRESS RELEASE: The UN’s Food Security and Analysis Unit in Somalia latest data on the food security situation that indicates that while the number of people severely food insecure has slightly dropped to 3.1 million people, the overall nutrition situation in Somalia has continued to deteriorate, especially in northern and central parts of Somalia.. Oxfam’s Acting Country Director for Somaliland, Harrie Oostingh said: “The increase in acute malnutrition, particularly in the hardest hit Sool and Sanaag regions in Somaliland, is deeply worrying. Over 380,000 children under five are at risk of dying from a lethal combination of severe hunger and deadly diseases such as measles and cholera. Given that we are in the middle of the lean season when food is scarcest, there will be no respite unless more aid is delivered quickly.. “Donors have been swift and generous in pledging funds to help, but the repeated calls to deliver on all the money promised cannot become a broken record. Any further delays will leave many people without life-saving assistance.”. Notes to editors:. The UN’s Food Security and Analysis Unit in Somalia latest assessment shows that 3.1 million Somalis are categorized in Crisis and Emergency (IPC Phases 3 & 4) and require interventions aimed at reducing food consumption gaps, reducing acute malnutrition, saving lives and protecting and saving livelihoods..

Alright, first let's set the scene:. Right after work, I had trouble crossing a street just in front of where I work. It was dark, and cars kept coming in from both direction. At one point, it looked like the way would be clear for a few seconds so I headed toward the other side, timing myself to cross right after a minivan had passed me.. It turned out that said minivan was carrying a small flatbed trailer *with no lights* so in the dark, I never even saw it. I was expecting to cross the road and instead, my knee smashed into the side of the moving trailer, sending me for a spin or two before crashing on the ground. After the initial shock where I was wondering what the hell I had just run into, I managed to get off the street, and incidentally confirming that I had no obvious bone fractures.. Thankfully, my apartment is 5 minutes away from a hospital and 10 minutes from work, so getting to the emergency room wasn't too had even though my leg did hurt quite a bit. Turns out nothing was broken and I just had a major bruise above my knee. Heck, I didn't even bleed (at least, not above the skin). After receiving a tetanus shot just in case, I was able to walk home with one heck of a battle scar!. ---. "With the first link, the chain is forged.

Does that hurt much anymore? Hope that heals well.. Wouldn't the driver of the minivan notice? That's pretty dumb of them and irresponsible to not make their trailers visible.. And I hope that's the only time I ever have to see a picture of you with your pants down.. Logged. TerraEsperZ. Hero Member. Posts: 2321.

That's my bathroom mat (well, a replacement anyway since I don't have a real dedicated mat). And as for what I was doing, well I hadn't been to the bathroom in over 19 hours, so it was kind of a priority after coming home. It was just quicker to take a picture then instead since simply removing my pants was painful enough at that point.. ---. "With the first link, the chain is forged.

Cases of sexual abuse of women go unreported in Banke. The cases of sexual abuse are weak and the accused are usually let free because the victims withdraw their complaints on their own accord or under pressure from family, police say.. Shutterstock. bookmark. facebook. twitter. Whatsapp. mail. Madhu Shahi. Published at : December 20, 2021. Updated at : December 20, 2021 07:57. Banke. Two years ago, the then 17-year-old girl approached the District Police Women and Children Service Centre in Banke with a complaint against her cousin who she said was making inappropriate advances towards her. The girl alleged that the man under the pretext of being family took advantage of her sexually.. But when the accused was brought to the police, he outright denied any wrongdoing. He said he was only teasing the girl and since she was his cousin, it was not a big deal, said Shyam Kumari Thapa, the then chief at the centre.. “The man insisted that he had done no wrong, that he was only fooling around with his cousin,” said Thapa. “But when a man as much as looks at a woman in a way that makes the woman uncomfortable is punishable by law. But this man was adamant that he had done no wrong in making advances at his cousin,” she said.. The victim persisted in her allegations but soon had to withdraw her complaint under immense family pressure. “Her family didn’t understand what she was going through. They put pressure on her to withdraw her complaint and to not register a police case against her cousin to save the man from disgrace,” said Thapa.. Thapa says she was determined to proceed with the case but she was not successful. “We were unable to help the victim. How could we have when she changed her statement albeit under coercion?” said Thapa. “Under our existing laws, any act of touching, looking, speaking with sexual undertones is categorised as sexual abuse. The perpetrator can be jailed between a minimum of three months and a maximum three years based on the nature of such cases,” she said. But in this case, law enforcement could not take action since the victim withdrew her verbal complaint and refused to register a formal complaint against her cousin. “They went for an out-of-court settlement. This is not a solitary case where women are forced to retract their complaints against their perpetrators by their family.”. A few weeks ago, the chief administrative officer and accounts officer of Khajura Rural Municipality in Banke were accused of sexually abusing a female employee. It was reported that the duo sexually abused the female employee, who is in her mid-thirties, while on a picnic at Tikapur in Kailali. The victim, a medical doctor by profession, informed police verbally about the abuse but later withdrew her complaint. “The victim signed an agreement with the accused to settle the case. She did not register a written complaint against her abusers so we could not take any action,” said Deputy Superintendent of Police in Banke Madhu Sudan Neupane.. The alleged sexual abuse of the woman came to the public’s notice five days after the incident when some women picketed the rural municipality office, demanding legal action against the accused.. According to police, the cases of sexual abuse are weak and the accused are usually let free because the victims withdraw their complaints on their own accord or under pressure from family.. Ekmaya BK, the vice-chairman of Khajura Rural Municipality, who is also the coordinator of the judicial committee at the local level, says most cases of sexual abuse and violence against women end up getting closed since the complainants reach a compromise with the accused.. According to human rights advocate Basanta Gautam, any sort of sexual abuse warrants the case to be registered as a criminal case. “There is	None	None	Topical	None	None	Sexual/	"<|im_sep|><Reasoning>
The text reports incidents of sexual abuse of women in Banke, Nepal, and how these cases often go unreported or are withdrawn due to family pressure. The text provides detailed accounts of specific incidents and the challenges faced by victims in seeking justice.

The text falls under the category of ""Topical"" for both Hate and Violence and Sexual content:
- For Hate and Violence, the text reports incidents of sexual abuse and the challenges faced by victims, which falls under (b.i) as it reports a hateful incident.
- For Sexual content, the text reports incidents of sexual abuse and provides details about the cases, which falls under (b.v) as it reports stats or incidents of sexual abuse without promoting it.

The text does not promote or advocate any conspiracy theories, misinformation, illegal activities, or self-harm, so the labels for Ideological Harm, Illegal, and Self-Inflicted content are ""None"".

Trimix is an injectable medication used for the treatment of ED. This medication varies in active ingredients and concentrations and is also known as BiMix, Trimix, or SuperMix. This sterile compounded medication is specially made in a compounding pharmacy which requires a prescription. TriMix is a self-administered penile injection designed for use immediately prior to sexual activity.. Phentolamine, Papaverine, and Prostaglandin (PGE1) are all known to increase blood flow to the penis, ultimately resulting in an erection. TriMix and other compounded penile injection therapies are fast-acting and long-lasting making it a notable option for patients suffering from ED.. Prescription required from your physician..

Remove safety cap from syringe and insert into vial. 4. Draw up designated dose and remove any air bubbles. 5. Clean injection site with alcohol swab. 6. Inject Trimix solution into the cavernosal muscle slowly until syringe is empty and safely discard syringe. 7. Apply pressure to injection site for up to 5 minutes to stop any bleeding and prevent scar tissue from forming. What it does. The combination of 3 different medications in Trimix work together to amplify and enhance erectile function as compared to a single medication.

Trimix begins working quickly in about 5-20 minutes and is expected to last up to 1 hour. Trimix is generally regarded as safe and effective while also providing an alternative to surgery when oral medications are not satisfactory. The injection is relatively painless and easy to administer.. Testimonials. “I never thought there was any help for me in restoring any of the damage I suffered with my penile fracture. I anticipated the scar tissue to permanently affect my normal length. After a few weeks of treatment with RestoreX, I noticed the retraction length getting longer. Not only that, but my girth had also come back to almost its original circumference. It’s only been a month of treatment, but I’m so grateful for the results I’ve received.”. Tom, 52 years old. “The inflatable penile prosthesis is an incredible device. A medical marvel! This device fully restores confidence and spontaneity in the bedroom, and as a bonus, no more shrinkage! I believe it should be a more openly discussed treatment option with your doctor.”. Scott. “I never thought there was any help for me in restoring any of the damage I suffered with my penile fracture. I anticipated the scar tissue to permanently affect my normal length.

White Ted Nugent on black Obama's speech. Posted bykkkaraoke February 14, 2013 Leave a comment on White Ted Nugent on black Obama's speech. White Ted Nugent, shock rocker, at Obama’s message yesterday. I never have watched a State of Union message, and even though I could get on computer, decided that I don’t even want to listen to Obama even to get angry or watch him. It is not for White women to “Idolize” black or Jew or other men. Yellow Chinese Communist women who don’t even have God have respect and show complete preference for yellow men. They don’t care if they are poor as long as they are “good” and have “character.” Sometimes I wonder which people us or them that are closer to God’s idea of the universe. Here’s from Ted Nugent. He blocked out most of the speech probably, but I give him credit for using his rock muscle to take a stand.. “My favorite part was when I couldn’t hear clearly,” said Mr. Nugent to reporters after the address. “Then, I didn’t get angry.”. I’m just wondering what the “white” statue behind him is all about. It seems as if something is broken or open. Also, there is another white statue behind that one. I’m sure the TV news “planned” where they were going to film him, that is why I wonder what the “background” white statues were all about. It’s called “White History” 101 and if our Jew schools won’t teach us our White history we need to “block” out the other histories, including black history, or Jew holocaust or Wiki that has us worship Jews, but find out our own history and “re-write” it in truth.. http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=50140946n.

She wants to play with her toys awhile. And school's out early and soon we'll be learning. That the lesson today is how -- to -- die. And then the bullhorn cackles. And the captain tackles. With the problems and the how's and why's. And he can see no reason. 'Cause there are no reason. What reason do you need to die. Die -- oh oh oh. Tell me why. I don't like Mondays. Tell me why.

Menu. ‘Mic Dispatch’ episode 19: Shaun King and the morality of doxxing people online (full transcript). Impact. ByMic Staff and Ingrid Ostby. Sep. 19, 2018. On this episode of Mic Dispatch, correspondent Aaron Morrison discusses doxxing with Twitter personality and journalist Shaun King. King has recently received backlash for retweeting content that has misidentified people suspected of racist actions. Morrison asks him about this and his moral obligation considering his huge internet following of over 3 million people across social media.. Shaun King: If you mistreat people, there are other people like me who will help hold you responsible for it.. Natasha Del Toro, anchor, Mic Dispatch: How do you feel when someone’s doxxed — meaning, their real identity and personal information are outed online? Doxxing usually happens after people have been caught behaving in ways many find problematic. Writer and activist Shaun King has come under intense scrutiny for his frequent doxxing, building a huge online following in part by outing people he deems racist. Correspondent Aaron Morrison talks to King about why he does it and about when he gets it wrong.. Morrison: Daniel Borden.. Anchor in news clip: Borden was identified on social media as one of the men seen in the photos attacking a black man earlier this month.. Morrison: Joseph Pryor.. Anchor in news clip: The man who was seen shouting at a black woman in a viral video taken at a Kentucky rally for Donald Trump has been discharged from the Marine Corps.. Morrison: Aaron Schlossberg.. Aaron Schlossberg in viral cell phone footage: They’re not documented, so my next call is to ICE to have each one of them kicked out of my country. Honey, I’m callin’ ICE!. Morrison: We know these names because these men have been accused of public racism and violence. And they are living on the internet in infamy. But how did we find out these names? Many say it’s because of an activist named Shaun King. Shaun King is a journalist and a political organizer who has [over] 3 million followers on social media. Some say he’s an internet vigilante. And others consider him a hero of the Black Lives Matter movement, largely because he exposes everyday racism and violence on the internet. I don’t know a whole lot about his methods. And I don’t even know if I could say all of his methods are ethical. So we’re gonna go sit down with Shaun.. Morrison: Shaun King’s on the way.. King: Hey!. Morrison: Hey, man!. King: Yeah, yeah. Thanks for having me. Glad to connect. How are things going?. Morrison: Things are good.. Morrison: In your mind, what are you achieving by exposing people who are accused of racism or police brutality or other sorts of immorality?. King: When someone does something like this publicly and we say, “Hey, what’s this person’s name? Who is this?” When we hold somebody responsible for that, one: We hope that it ends their public behavior. But we also hope it sends a message to other people that you are free to be publicly hateful. Just know that you might be known for it. Our goal isn’t so much to ruin somebody’s life as it is to stop the bigotry. The system doesn’t do that work for us, so we have to do it ourselves.. Morrison (voiceover): King has been credited with helping law enforcement arrest Alex Michael Ramos and Daniel Borden, who were convicted over the summer for beating a young black man named DeAndre Harris during the Unite the Right events in Charlottesville, Virginia.. Protesters in clip: Black lives matter, black lives matter.. King: I was watching livestream videos. I was horrified. He had just a huge gash across his head, was covered in blood, and I thought, “They could have killed this young man.” But I had the thought, “If these guys do this and just walk, this is gonna happen all over the country.” I wrote a tweet just saying, “Who is this? Who are these men who did this?”. Morrison (voiceover): King was praised for his work after Charlottesville. He was recognized as a humanitarian at the 2018 BET Awards and was invited to give a commencement speech at the City University of New York in June.. Morrison: Can you take us through what actually happens as you’re sort of narrowing down who some of these folks are?. King: The first thing that we did was just collect a ton of information: photos, videos, personal accounts. Second thing that we did was began to actually catalog and organize them. So we created individual files for each person that we saw there — to verify their information. There were so many things that	None	None	None	Topical	None	Illegal/	"<|im_sep|><Reasoning>

Court of Urgent Matters expected to issue a verdict in the lawsuit that demands the disbanding of all political parties with a religious platform. Share. URL Copied.

The Court of Urgent Matters is expected to issue a verdict this week in the lawsuit that demands the disbanding of all political parties with a religious platform.. The lawsuit was filed by Tarek Mahmoud, legal advisor of the Popular Front against the Brotherhoodization of Egypt, established in 2012 after the Muslim Brotherhood came to power.. Mahmoud based his lawsuit on Article 74 of the 2013 constitution, drafted after the toppling of Brotherhood rule, which says “all citizens have the right to establish political parties as regulated by the law provided that those parties are not formed on the basis of religion, gender or ethnic discrimination, sectarianism, or geographical location.”. The article also says political parties can only be dissolved through a court order.. Mahmoud demands that the Supreme Elections Committee, which will supervise the upcoming parliamentary elections, be instructed to reject the nomination papers of the 11 parties targeted by the lawsuit.. Mahmoud won an earlier lawsuit that banned Brotherhood members from taking part in parliamentary elections on the basis of its designation as a terrorist group.. He later accused other religious parties of pledging allegiance to the Brotherhood. “Most leaders of those parties fled, or are detained for collaborating with the Muslim Brotherhood and inciting violence against the state,” he said.. According to the complaint filed with the Court of Urgent Matters, religious parties “have been using politics as a façade for engaging in religious practices in violation of the Egyptian constitution.”. If those parties take part in parliamentary elections and win, the complaint said, Egypt will face “a serious threat” since they will exploit religion to achieve their goals and issue legislation that serves their agendas.. The complaint says the threat is intensified by the fact that many of those parties still consider the June 30 protests that toppled Brotherhood rule a military coup, and so do not recognize the current government.. Mahmoud said due to the unconstitutionality of religious parties, the parliament in which they win seats would be similarly unconstitutional. “The parliament itself would, therefore, be prone to dissolution.”. Judge Mohamed Hamed al-Gamal, former chairman of the State Council, said religious parties should face the same fate as the Brotherhood since they have the same ideological reference.. “Those parties don’t acknowledge borders and aren’t loyal to the nation, but rather to what they claim is the Islamic caliphate,” he said.. Gamal added that there is no need for another court order to disband religious parties since there is already a precedent in the case of the Brotherhood.. “The state, as represented by the president and the cabinet, should make a decision to apply the previous verdict on all similar parties,” he said.. Minister of Islamic Endowments Mohamed Mokhtar Gomaa said each party in question “uses religion to impose its ideologies - which are usually fanatical - on society, and they go to extremes as they at times accuse others of apostasy and even sanction their bloodshed.”. Gomaa said those organizations use community work as a pretext to take advantage of the religious tendencies of Egyptians in order to gain power.. “That’s why the presence of these parties constitutes a grave threat to the fabric of Egyptian society and jeopardizes its unity,” he said.. Shawki al-Sayed, professor of constitutional law, said the history of Islamist groups has long demonstrated the dangers of mixing religion and politics.. “This goes back to 1948, when then-Interior Minister Abdel Rahman Omar exposed the crimes of the Brotherhood and highlighted the	Topical	Topical	None	None	None	Hate/Ideologi/	"<|im_sep|><Reasoning>

The 1960s was a really dark period for the Italian community I think; mass migration and the predominantly rural community here from Italy with quite distinct and different – you know they were visibly different, because there were masses coming from southern Italy so they were visibly different in very big numbers and so they did start posing a threat. And so there was a lot of racism in the ‘60s, there was a divide in factories, you know, there was – the Australian women were on one side of the factory floor and the Italian women and the Greek women were on the other side of the factory floor. They wouldn’t talk to each other. And that was the same in schools and there was that division in factories.. 00:59. I recall my mother talking about the fact that her Australian workmates would barely say two words to the Italian women and they didn’t care, they only fought for their rights, they didn’t care about the rights of the migrants and they felt as second class citizens. And Dad who was a skilled migrant and very good technician, even though respected for his skills by his management and by the owners of the factories by his colleagues – by his workmates, he wasn’t. I do recall Dad coming home with black eyes and there’d be fights after work or at lunchtime, you know where he’d be called a “wog” and told – and told to go back to his home country and, you know a dago etcetera.. 01:50. So, yeah, I do remember Dad coming home with black eyes from time to time due to fights that occurred on the factory floor, so it – I can imagine I mean, I was a young girl but I do remember this, I can imagine it could have been quite nasty and I know my mother was very resentful of the Australian women who she thought got together as a group and protected their interests but wouldn’t help the – the migrant women and left them to do all the hard work. All the bits at the – on the conveyor belt that were too hard, were always given to the – to the migrant women to do. And you know, when you’re being paid at piece work, piece by piece, they could never make the same salary that the Australian women did because they were given the hard bits to do. So there was this resentment in the factories between the two.. 02:40. My mother worked in a textile mill and then she worked in an electrical factory where they made components for TVs and radios. Dad worked in various places, but he was a maintenance fitter so he was very skilled and never out of work. And he worked in a car part supplier, he worked, they made I think toasters, electrical things, so yeah, he’s – he was – yeah he did. He actually liked work. He thought – and that, he felt – my parents have always defended Australia, even though, you know, there was this harshness in the beginning, because of the opportunities and they would – never considered going back, even though they were, you know, didn’t have any family members here.. 03:44. But I think the ‘60s, speaking to a lot of the Italians that I’ve interviewed over the years, they all agree that the ’60s was a really hard time.. 03:53. End transcript.

BERLÍN – La megaminera Glencore lleva más de una década extrayendo cobre en la provincia peruana de Espinar. En ese período, se ha documentado exhaustivamente la presencia de metales tóxicos en el medioambiente y en las personas del lugar. Pero no fue sino hace poco que el gobierno peruano reconoció lo que para muchos in situ era evidente: un vínculo causal entre las operaciones de Glencore en Antapaccay y la contaminación en Espinar.

Aaron Schwartz/Xinhua via Getty Images. Politics 0. The Supreme Court Is Shaking America’s Fiscal Foundations. Aziz Huq sounds the alarm about a dangerous trend in US constitutional law that is showing no signs of abating.. A pesar del considerable aumento en la demanda de cobre (y de otros minerales críticos que se usan en las tecnologías verdes), extraer y refinar estos recursos todavía es exclusividad de un puñado de países. China, por ejemplo, es responsable de más del 70% de la extracción de tierras raras y del 50% del procesamiento de grafito natural, cobalto, litio y manganeso. Esta dependencia de un único país genera cada vez más preocupación en Europa desde que empezó la guerra en Ucrania.. En marzo, la presidenta de la Comisión Europea Ursula von der Leyenseñaló que «estamos en carrera» para alcanzar el dominio futuro de las tecnologías de energía limpia, al anunciar la nueva ley sobre materias primas fundamentales, con la que se busca reducir las dependencias que hoy tiene la Unión Europea. Junto con la propuesta de ley sobre una industria de emisión neta cero, es la respuesta del bloque a la Ley de Reducción de la Inflación aprobada en Estados Unidos, que incluye un compromiso con aumentar el suministro local de minerales críticos.. El resurgimiento de la política industrial no es la única prueba de que el mundo está comprendiendo la importancia de las materias primas. Hace unos meses, la Agencia Internacional de la Energía celebró la primera cumbre mundial de la historia sobre los minerales críticos y su papel en la transición verde. Y en el discurso que pronunció ante la dirigencia internacional reunida para la Conferencia de las Naciones Unidas sobre el Cambio Climático (COP28) celebrada a fines de este año, el secretario general de la ONU António Guterres se refirió a la necesidad de satisfacer de la mejor manera posible la creciente demanda de cobre, litio, cobalto y otros materiales.. Es decir que la industria minera (que la ONU considera un sector de alto riesgo para los derechos humanos) tendrá un papel esencial en la transición energética. En este contexto, muchos líderes europeos están dispuestos a hacer la vista gorda frente a violaciones de los derechos humanos y daños medioambientales de la industria. Pero eso puede atentar contra los intentos de la UE de asegurarse el acceso a materias primas y mitigar el cambio climático.. En su discurso, Guterres recalcó que la extracción de minerales críticos «debe hacerse en forma sostenible, justa y equitativa» para no repetir los «errores del pasado» (en referencia a la pauta histórica por la que los países ricos han explotado en forma sistemática el patrimonio de recursos naturales de los países en desarrollo). Para ello, anunció la creación de un nuevo panel con representantes de los gobiernos, de la industria y de la sociedad civil, que se encargará de redactar normas de cumplimiento voluntario para las industrias extractivas. A esto se suma la Asociación de Seguridad de Minerales, una alianza de gobiernos de países ricos con la que se busca mejorar los indicadores ambientales, sociales y de gobernanza corporativa (ASG/ESG) de la industria mundial de los minerales..

The text talks about the mining industry and its impact on the environment and human rights. It reports on the presence of toxic metals in the environment and the people of Espinar due to Glencore's operations. The text also discusses the European Union's efforts to reduce dependency on a single country for critical minerals and the need for sustainable and equitable extraction of these minerals.

The Problem With ‘Self-Investigation’ in a Post-Truth Era. No one would argue that Edgar Welch, the 28-year-old North Carolina man who loaded his car with weapons in early December and drove 350 miles to liberate the children he believed were being held in the basement of a Washington pizzeria, was a model citizen or even necessarily sane. But after a tragedy had been averted and he was in police custody, Welch transformed himself into something of an unlikely sage, stumbling on a surprisingly resonant explanation for the misguided quest that sent him ricocheting from internet conspiracy theories to armed vigilantism: He had decided, he said, to “self-investigate.”. At first, it sounds like a useless neologism: Aren’t all investigations self-investigations? But in today’s morass of disinformation — the “post-truth era” — the phrase reveals a radical new relationship between citizen and truth. Millions of people like Welch are abandoning traditional sources of information, from the government to the institutional media, in favor of a D.I.Y. approach to fact-finding. What they are doing is not quite investigating. It is self-investigating.. The phrase twins the American virtues of truth-seeking and individual resolve and suggests, at least superficially, an appealing, bootstrapping approach to information gathering. But an investigator tries to get to the bottom of things. For the self-investigator, there is no bottom, in large part because self-investigation — as I am defining it here — is confined to the internet. Proceeding from the assumption that the so-called experts are not to be trusted, self-investigators are pushed and pulled by the churn of memes and social media, an endless loop of echoes, reflections and intentional lies. With only themselves and their appetites as a guide, they bypass any information that doesn’t suit their predisposition and worldview. The self-investigator’s media diet is like an endless breakfast buffet, only without the guilt: Take what you want, leave what you don’t.. Our most famous self-investigator is, of course, our incoming president, Donald J. Trump; perhaps no one is more committed to embracing and trumpeting unproven claims from the internet. Six years ago, as he flirted with the idea of running for president, he became especially preoccupied with a theory being advanced by a right-wing extremist named Joseph Farah. A self-described ex-Communist, Farah presided over a nonprofit organization, the Western Center for Journalism, which was dedicated to promoting “philosophical diversity” in the news media, and now runs a popular website, WorldNetDaily, which bills itself as “America’s Independent News Network.” The Southern Poverty Law Center, an organization that monitors U.S. hate groups, has a different point of view, calling Farah “the internet king of the antigovernment ‘Patriot’ movement.”. Somewhere along the way, the democratization of the flow of information became the democratization of the flow of disinformation.. Farah had floated plenty of specious arguments in the past, among them the claim that gay men orchestrated the Holocaust and that Muslims have a 20-point plan for conquering the United States by 2020. But the Farah campaign that captured Trump’s imagination held that America’s first black president, Barack Obama, might have been born outside the United States. Trump talked about this notion almost nonstop; he even said he was considering sending private investigators to Hawaii to prove that the president’s birth certificate was a forgery.. Farah later said he was surprised that a “multibillionaire” would make so much time for a side project like this. But single-minded persistence is the essence of self-investigation. Trump, for instance, also continued to insist on the guilt of the Central Park Five — five teenagers, four black and one Latino, whose convictions in the 1989 rape and beating of a jogger were later overturned — long after they had been exonerated by DNA evidence and the detailed confession of a serial rapist. Indeed, when Trump finally decided to let the birther issue go at an event at his new Washington, D.C., hotel in September, he also accused Hillary Clinton of starting the whole controversy. He was closing one self-investigation but providing fresh fodder for another.. The great promise of the internet was that it would bring democracies together, giving more people more access to more information, all beyond the control of any single authority. Curious citizens could develop a more nuanced understanding of what was going on; voters would be better informed; we would ferret out the truth from the bottom up and greater freedom would be the inevitable result.

A law establishing uniform drug-testing rules for major U.S. sports would be a mistake, NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue told Congress, while defending his league's steroid policy under questioning from lawmakers who were far less adversarial than during last month's baseball hearing.. Apr 27, 2005 at 02:00 AM. Copied!. WASHINGTON (April 27, 2005) -- A law establishing uniform drug-testing rules for major U.S. sports would be a mistake, NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue told Congress, while defending his league's steroid policy under questioning from lawmakers who were far less adversarial than during last month's baseball hearing.. "We don't feel that there is rampant cheating in our sport," Tagliabue told the House Government Reform Committee.. Members of the panel asked whether the size of today's NFL players is evidence of steroid use, they criticized football's penalties as too lenient, and asked whether amphetamines should be banned and when growth hormone will be tested for.. "How is the average American supposed to look at the size, strength and speed of today's NFL linebackers and not conclude that they might be taking performance-enhancing drugs?" asked chairman Tom Davis, R-Va.. Tagliabue countered: "We're certainly not going to jump to the conclusion that because we have larger athletes today there is increased steroid use in the National Football League. I think it's nonsense.". On the whole, congressmen generally praised the NFL for its cooperation, with more than one calling this session a "breath of fresh air" compared to Major League Baseball's hearing.. Still, the committee didn't get a direct answer as to how widespread steroid use might be in the NFL. Lawmakers tried to gauge that level in baseball on March 17, when an 11-hour hearing featured Mark McGwire, Jose Canseco and other past and current stars.. In this hearing, only two former NFL players were present, and one was Hall of Famer Gene Upshaw, invited because he's the NFL Players Association chief executive.. The other was Steve Courson, an offensive lineman for the Pittsburgh Steelers and Tampa Bay Buccaneers from 1978-85. He has admitted using steroids and said they probably played a role in his developing a heart condition.. Courson delivered his statement to dozens of empty black leather chairs: Only one member of the committee was present, because others left for a floor vote.. Later, when asked by ranking Democrat Henry Waxman of California what percentage of pro football players use steroids today, Courson said: "That would be	None	None	None	None	Topical	SelfInfl/	"<|im_sep|><Reasoning>

Do Not Waste Your Brain Cells Watching Chuck Todd Interview Donald Trump. By David Boddiger | June 23, 2019 | 8:26pm. Trumpland. For 35 long, dreadful, maddening minutes I watched two of the most annoying men in political news sit down for a televised interview that may have actually left viewers dumber than when they started. Call it the Dueling Comb-Overs.. In an interview recorded Friday and broadcast on Sunday, Chuck Todd, of NBC’s Meet the Press, questioned the president on an array of topics, from crimes against humanity happening to migrant children in concentration camps at the southern border to Trump’s nonchalant dismissal of the kidnapping, torture, and murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.. The common thread throughout the interview was Trump’s habitual lying, his bragging, and his incessant need to play the victim. And of course there were plenty of attacks on Obama.. It wasn’t that Todd’s questions were particularly bad—although some were—but we’ve heard all of these lies before, and the fact that they’re presented together, in one sitting, doesn’t make Trump look any more or less presidential than he already does to viewers on either Fox News or NBC.. After being appropriately condemned earlier this week for his criticism of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s accurate use of the term “concentration camps” to describe conditions at detention facilities for migrant children, Todd tried to sound more compassionate with his questioning about the Trump administration’s soul-crushing mistreatment of children.. “I want to ask what’s going down with the children in these migrant camps. The stories are horrible, Mr. President. You have children without their parents. You have kids taking care of kids,” Todd said, to which Trump replied, “Yeah.”. “Why aren’t you doing something?” Todd asked.. “It’s been that way for a long time,” Trump responded [cue attack on Obama]. “And President Obama built the cages. Remember when they said that I built them? And then it was 1914 [1914?! What?]…It was 2014. Chuck, just listen for one second.”. “Separation, President Obama, I took over separation,” Trump continued. “I’m the one that put it together. What’s happened though are the cartels and all of these bad people, they’re using the kids. They’re, they’re, it’s almost like slavery.”. “But let’s not punish the kids more,” Todd responded.. What’s this? Empathy? What exactly are the political implications of empathy, Chuck?. Of course, it should be pointed out that Trump’s response is an utter lie. In fact, nearly a year ago to the day, NBC fact-checked this lie, which was being circulated at the time by Trump, then-Department of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen, former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, and other Republican hacks. Back in June 2018, Trump had said that family separations had been going on “for 50 years or longer.”. The truth is that Donald Trump and his former Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered the “zero tolerance” policy to be implemented, which ripped children by the thousands from their parents at the border, a mass-scale policy of abuse that has ended in the inhumane and criminal conditions we’re seeing at detention centers today. Only public condemnation convinced Trump to backtrack and rescind the policy.. Here’s Donald Trump’s warped version of reality (emphasis mine):. “You’re right. And this has been happening long before I got there. What we’ve done is we’ve created, we’ve, we’ve ended separation. You know, under President Obama you had separation. I was the one that ended it. Now I said one thing, when I ended it I said, ‘Here’s what’s going to happen. More families are going to come up.’ And that’s what’s happened. But they’re really coming up for the economics. But once you ended the separation. But I ended separation. I inherited separation from President Obama. President Obama built, they call them jail cells.”. Trump also muttered a sentence that will infuriate anyone who’s been paying attention to the situation with migrant children lately: “We’re doing a fantastic job under the circumstances.”. Then he blamed Democrats, saying, “If the Democrats would change the asylum laws and the loopholes, which they refuse to do because they think it’s good politics, everything would be solved immediately.”. A little later, Todd asked Trump, “Do you think impeachment’s good politics for you?. There are a million comments I could make about this question, but I want to get back to Jeff Sessions. Todd asked Trump what he would change if he could have a do-over as president. Without giving it much thought,	Topical	Intent	None	None	None	Hate/Ideologi/	"<|im_sep|><Reasoning>

Helen Vernon, chief executive at NHS Resolution, talks about a recent court case which firmly demonstrates that there is no space for contempt, dishonesty and fraud in the NHS.. As with all NHS organisations, the risk of fraud is a significant concern for NHS Resolution. The nature of our work inevitably focuses attention on the risk of fraudulent claims being brought against our members, and we take a zero-tolerance attitude towards fraud while ensuring that legitimate claimants are compensated fairly.. It is estimated that fraud, bribery, and corruption affecting the NHS cost the public purse £1.25bn a year. This is enough money to pay for over 40,000 staff nurses, or to purchase over 5,000 frontline ambulances.. Fraud against the NHS means that taxpayer money intended for patient care ends up in the pockets of those who are not entitled to it. It means fewer resources are available to be spent on frontline health services such as patient care, facilities, doctors, nurses, and other staff.. NHS Resolution responds firmly to any case where we suspect exaggeration or fraud and we deploy a number of techniques to do so, working closely with partners such as the NHS Counter Fraud Authority. We have adopted tried-and-tested techniques utilised by the insurance industry. For example, we receive over 4,000 claims every year from the NHS which have nothing to do with clinical treatment and arise from injuries to NHS employees or members of the public, such as slipping on ice in a hospital carpark.. When a ‘non-clinical’ claim like this comes in, it is assessed against a checklist of ‘fraud indicators’ in order to validate the claim. If there are suspicions, it will be passed onto our fraud team for investigation. Indications of a potential fraud could range from evidence of previous dishonest behaviour by the claimant, evidence of claims for a similar accident, or a delay in reporting the incident.. For all claims, our investigations may take a number of routes legally available to us from open-source material searches, such as looking at social media profiles or using surveillance if we have concerns. When authorising surveillance, we always consider the privacy of the surveillance subject and the risk of intrusion before proceeding, and there must be a strong justification – such as a medical expert reporting that the injury displayed is not credible.. While it is very rarely used, surveillance helps to protect the public purse from paying unreasonable or unjustified levels of compensation. One example of a recent landmark case where NHS Resolution pursued action, which ultimately resulted in the imprisonment of the fraudulent claimant, was that of Sandip Atwal.. Atwal, from Huddersfield, went to hospital for injuries to his hands and lip after being attacked in 2008. He said the treatment he received had left him unemployed and dependent. Fractures of two fingers and a laceration of the lower lip were negligently treated. In 2011, Calderdale and Huddersfield NHS FT offered £30,000 to settle the case, but this was not accepted.. However, over the next five years, Atwal systematically fabricated and exaggerated his claims. His schedule of loss of £837,109 included very substantial sums for future care and loss of earnings, on the basis he was unable to work and grossly incapacitated.. The trust’s legal team were suspicious as his claimed disabilities were inconsistent with entries in the contemporaneous medical records. Covert video surveillance of Atwal in 2015 exposed him working and lifting heavy items, using his phone, and driving with ease. His social media posts also showed him working as a DJ – under the name Sunny KMS – including featuring in a music video.. On 27 April 2018 Atwal was found guilty of 14 counts of contempt of court, and on 1 June, following an application on the instructions of NHS Resolution and the NHS trust, he was jailed for three months.. The case sends a strong message that the NHS is not an easy target, and fraudulent claims cannot be submitted with impunity. We will properly examine all claims that are presented to us and where there is a legitimate claim, we will	None	None	None	Topical	None	Illegal/	"<|im_sep|><Reasoning>

https://montrealsimon.blogspot.com/2020/09/donald-trump-and-debate-from-hell.html	eng	Montreal Simon: Donald Trump And the Debate From Hell. Wednesday, September 30, 2020. Donald Trump And the Debate From Hell. I don't know how I managed to watch the whole debate. I had a splitting headache when it was over.. But at least just seconds after it did finally end, CNN's Jake Tapper made me feel like I wasn't alone.. “That was a hot mess, inside a dumpster fire, inside a train wreck. That was the worst debate I have ever seen. It wasn’t even a debate. It was a disgrace.”. For it was monstrous.. And The Beast has rarely looked so beastly.. He trampled on the debate's decorum.. The first presidential debate between President Trump and Joseph R. Biden Jr. unraveled into an ugly melee Tuesday, as Mr. Trump hectored and interrupted Mr. Biden nearly every time he spoke and the former vice president denounced the president as a “clown” and told him to “shut up.”. He acted like a disgusting bully.. Mr. Trump, trailing in the polls and urgently hoping to revive his campaign, was plainly attempting to be the aggressor. But he interjected so insistently that Mr. Biden could scarcely answer the questions posed to him, forcing the moderator, Chris Wallace of Fox News, to repeatedly urge the president to let his opponent speak.. He once again refused to commit to respecting the election result.. But the worst thing he did was give the violent white supremacist group the Proud Boys a shout out.. Far-right groups celebrated on social media Tuesday night after President Trump responded to a debate question about white supremacists by saying that the extremist Proud Boys, a male-only group known for its penchant for street violence, should “stand back and stand by.”. Trump’s comments came in response to a question from the moderator, Fox News anchor Chris Wallace, about whether he would be willing to publicly denounce white supremacists. The president suggested he would before adding, “Proud Boys, stand back and stand by. But I’ll tell you what, somebody’s got to do something about antifa and the left.”. Which had the Proud Boys celebrating.. On the Proud Boys' account on the social media app Telegram, the group appeared to take the statement as marching orders.. "Standing down and standing by sir," the account wrote. The account then posted two videos of the answer, including one with the caption "God. Family. Brotherhood," in which a man howled at the TV in response to Trump's response.. Some even adding Trump's words to their fascist t-shirts.... And are no doubt standing by now to attack their opponents, just to please their dumpling Fuhrer.. Which practically guarantees that whatever the result, the election will end in a bloodbath.. Meanwhile back in Canada... what do you think the debate headline was in this morning's National Post?. Right. I couldn't believe it either.. But I did say this on Twitter.... Because it needs to be said before the Cons and their shabby stooge media drag this country into the Trump cult.. The Big or Bigot Orange now claims that he doesn't know who the Proud Boys are.. But thanks to his abominable performance he will wear their racism forever..... Posted by Simon at 8:36 PM. 5 comments:. Jackie Blue said.... So apparently there were some segments about Trump and Proud Boys tonight, but it was just Vichy and Evan so of course none of them mentioned the Rebelcon connection. And why would they, when CTV and Globe are owned by the same billionaires and the Globe's editor in chief invited Ezra to do an op-ed about how Trudeau was blocking his "free speech". Obviously if Trudeau was blocking his free speech he never would have written the article, let alone had it published in the "paper of record". The Globe isn't fit for emergency COVID toilet paper and Evan remains an idiot, Canada's version of Sean Hannity.. Vichy had a "body language" expert on to talk about why Trump actually won the debate because he was muscular and confident and Biden looked weak. Cancel this fucking show already. She might as well have had on a fortune teller or a phrenologist. This same guy was on during the election season and said that Scheer came across as honest. Christ, what a poor judge of character. He reminded me of some right-wing blogger and wannabe armchair psychologist who had "diagnosed" Trudeau with bipolar and PTSD as a victim of "Illuminati ritual sexual abuse" based on a warped interpretation of his book. Who the hell is on call at CBC giving the greenlight to this pseudoscientific shit? What's next, Vichy inviting the My Pillow guy to extol the benefits of hydroxychloroquine?.

What happens when you have to live with your mafioso ex-lover because your husband used you as collateral to pay his debts? The past that she's been trying to erase is coming back suddenly. Ayuma was in a dilemma; she missed her former lover Rollan, but she also couldn't betray her husband Bastian because faithfulness in marriage was everything to her. "I've already let you go, Ayu. But this time, I'll never let you go again." I tried to close my eyes and block out the image of his nudity in my mind. I tried to block out everything about him from inside me, but our togetherness rekindled the sparks of longing. He was the villain in our story, and it was insane that I was willing to kneel in his presence. Rollan had always known how to control me. Being with him for the first time, I was willing to break all of the rules, even though bad things might happen to me soon. It's time for the story to change. This time, the villain would win the story, and the hero would die without being able to fight back at all. It's about time this story became more interesting, isn't it?. more.

No, it's not because of the night breeze in the courtyard of Prambanan temple, where I'm dancing right now, but because of the intense and cold gaze of the Shah family's son, Rollan Keenan Shah. The heirs to tens of hectares of palm oil plantations in Sumatra and Kalimantan and the owners of coal mines reportedly spread across the country had to pay off corrupt politicians in this country to make their wealth. The Shah family has been a protected mafia family since the country's independence. There are many sins that they have committed over generations, and that has kept the family untouchable.The man sat at the front; he didn't seem to be enjoying the show, and his gaze only focused on one point: me. Ayuma Ralline Wijaya: I'm the one who just had an unfortunate accident because my husband, who had just married me two weeks ago, made me collateral for his company's debts.Should I kill myself like Pitaloka in pursuit of my dignity and honor? Or do I have to be patient and wait, like Dewi Sinta, whom I am currently starring as until my husband is willing to save me from a man like Rollan's clutches?I don't know; I don't have a choice, and I dare not choose because they are all equally bad for me.. After I finished the performance, I immediately hid in my makeup room and had plans to escape from this place, but when I just took off some accessories attached to my head, someone came in without permission."You! What are you doing here?" I shouted. Luckily, I was still wearing clothes; I couldn't imagine that he would see me naked.The man smirked sarcastically. "I think you've forgotten your current status, Ayu. You must come with me until your dear husband can pay all his debts to me."I gave him a stern glare. "You know what? Your business with Bastian has nothing to do with me at all. The agreement between the two of you is invalid under the law! Besides, I've already filed for divorce from Bastian," I said with a victorious smile."Oh yeah?" he said with a raised eyebrow. "The agreement is valid, sweetheart. Because I've anticipated everything, you won't be able to report me to the police, run away from me, or do anything stupid," he said.Then he walked towards me until the distance between us was only a few centimeters, and I could smell the masculine scent oozing from his body. I swallow my saliva harshly. I could see his face very clearly. Rollan was much taller than me; hence, he had to look down when he saw me, and I must admit, he was very handsome if only his face did not have two scars on his left eye, making his sharp eyes look even more terrifying.. "What do you want?" I asked in a trembling voice."What would I do?""Yes, if you dare to touch me, I'll scream for people to beat you like a f*ck*ng thief!"He just grinned and breathed in the scent of my body.

Jennie Hogan finds the suffering of two lesbian Evangelicals shocking. mark woodward/daniel Easton. Jayne Ozanne, now back on the General Synod, takes the podium at this summer’s sessions in York. Jayne Ozanne, now back on the General Synod, takes the podium at this summer’s sessions in York. I WAS invited to attend a church while on the dance floor of an LGBT nightclub; so the experience of reading heart-rending memoirs written by lesbians from the Evangelical tradition was at times perplexing and fascinating.. There is startling similarity between these two accounts: both are bright, confident, young women, successful academically and professionally. It is clear that Vicky Beeching and Jayne Ozanne were once comfortably embedded in the conservative Charismatic Evangelical church communities; they were enlivened and loved. Indeed, we learn of Beeching’s dazzling career writing and performing popular worship songs in the United States, and Ozanne’s position of authority in the Archbishops’ Council. Yet, as we see in their frank stories, their zeal and commitment to serving and worshipping God broke their hearts, minds, and bodies.. It is interesting that neither recognised that beyond the cultish bubble where religious literalism and patriarchy reigned, LGBT people in the UK were increasingly finding a voice and disrupting Christian approaches to human sexuality. Such ground-breaking and exciting activity contrasts starkly with the writers’ descriptions of exorcisms, “healing” ministries, and conversion therapies. Ozanne was spiritually abused and fleeced by groups hell-bent on delivering her from desire for another human being; in Beeching’s accounts, we witness her mutely observing such atrocities while she inwardly expires.. Beeching’s book is dedicated to a 15-year-old girl, Lizzie Lowe, who killed herself because she was afraid of telling her Christian community that she was gay. Moreover, we read in both accounts that suicide seemed at times to be a very real option. It is, therefore, unsurprising to discover how prolonged experience of hiding, self-hatred, and isolation has led to severe physical illness.. Thankfully — miraculously, even — each woman found the steel to survive, and the courage to write her own shattering testimony. Beeching has many young fans, and her memoir seeks to offer a lifeline to gay Christians. Her chapter on grappling with the Bible as a means of self-acceptance will provide sensible signposts. Ozanne has been at the heart of church politics, and there is no doubt that her book will challenge many readers, not least some General Synod members whose homophobic views are alive and kicking.. Advertisement. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgendered people all have their own “coming-out” story, and most don’t find their ways into books. Crucially, however, here we learn of the excruciating consequences of the authors’ revealing their sexual identity to Evangelical friends, families, and work colleagues. The phone stops ringing; invitations end; work dries up. Ozanne admits: “I felt I was living in total exile.”. We discover how telling the truth spiritually, financially, and emotionally punishes them. Beeching writes: “I wanted to please God with my life, yet I was being compared to people who had sex with animals or abused children.” Worse than the vitriol is the silence of those they once counted as friends and fellow followers of Jesus Christ.. Both authors recognise that daring to tell the truth has set them free, but the suffering has by no means abated. Each writes with openness and insight; and their gracious restraint is astonishing. At points, I was left fuming at the injustices and suffering that they have endured in the name of the Christian faith. We can only hope that their memoirs will not only change the hearts of those who have damaged many LGBT Christians, but also begin to mend hearts that have been broken by shame and exclusion.. Will the Church ever be undivided, as Beeching longs for it to be, so that,	Topical	Topical	None	None	None	Hate/Ideologi/	"<|im_sep|><Reasoning>
The text is a review of two books on self-acceptance written by lesbian Evangelicals. It discusses the struggles and suffering faced by the authors due to their sexual orientation and their experiences within the conservative Charismatic Evangelical church communities. The text highlights issues such as spiritual abuse, conversion therapies, and the impact of revealing one's sexual identity on personal and professional life.

The text reports incidents of hate and violence faced by the authors, such as spiritual abuse and conversion therapies, without promoting or justifying them. This makes the Hate and Violence label ""Topical-i"" as it reports hateful incidents.

The text also discusses the bias and discrimination faced by the authors due to their sexual orientation, without promoting or justifying it. This makes the Ideological Harm label ""Topical-iii"" as it reports bias against a group of people.

The text does not contain any explicit sexual content, nor does it promote or discuss any illegal activities or self-inflicted harm. Therefore, the labels for Sexual, Illegal, and Self-Inflicted content are ""None"".

Comments. Discovery. February 24, 1994 was the beginning of the end -- the end of the extraordinary things that had been going on in the ordinary three-story house in central Gloucester. But it was also the beginning of a discovery as the layers of secrets hidden at 25 Cromwell Street were slowly peeled away.. That afternoon, the police came to find the owner of the house, Frederick West. Instead, they found his heavy set, sullen wife Rosemary, who called her husband the minute they handed her the warrant. "You'd better get back home," she told Fred when he answered the cellular phone in his van. "They're going to dig up the garden, looking for Heather.". Heather West. (South West News. Services). The dark-haired, simian-looking man was not worried except that the police wouldn't clean up the mess they were sure to make lifting up the patio stones in his garden, looking for the body of their daughter. He stopped by the police station on his way home from work. He told them he and Rose had no idea where Heather was, but he was not worried. "Lots of girls disappear," he explained, "take a different name and go into prostitution." He said she was a lesbian and had problems with drugs.. Rose, who was interviewed at the house, told a similar story. Heather disappeared at the age of sixteen, back in 1987. She repeated the story about Heather being a disagreeable and lazy person and a lesbian to boot.. That night Fred and Rose stayed up all night and talked. The next morning, he stepped into the police car. "I killed her," he told Detective Constable Hazel Savage. When he got to the station, he told the police in minute detail how he had cut Heather's body into three pieces and buried them. He kept repeating that Rose had known nothing about the murder at all.. Twenty minutes later he completely denied everything he had just told them. "Heather's alive and well, right. She's possibly at the moment in Bahrain working for a drug cartel. She had a Mercedes, a chauffeur and a new birth certificate." He told the police that they could dig all they wanted but they wouldn't find Heather.. The police found three human bones, but they didn't belong to Heather. When Fred heard that human bones had been found, he confessed once again to murdering his daughter, but he denied that there were the bones of anyone else buried there.. Fred told how it all happened. The argument with the headstrong Heather, slapping her for her insolence and grabbing her throat to stop her from laughing at him. He must have grabbed too hard because she turned blue and stopped breathing. He tried to revive her, but he didn't have the training, so he dragged her over to the bathtub and ran cold water over her. He took off her clothes, lifted her out of the tub and dried her off. Then he tried to put her in the large garbage bin, but she didn't fit.. So it was back in the bathtub where he knew he would have to make her smaller. But first, he strangled her with some tights just to make sure that she was dead. " I didn't want to touch he while she was alive. I meanif I'd have started cutting her leg or her throat and she'd have suddenly come alive". He closed Heather's eyes before he dismembered her. "If somebody's sat there looking at you, you're not going to use a knife on that person are you?". When he cut off her head, he found the sound -- a "horrible noiselike scrunching" -- very unpleasant. But, once her head was off, he started on her legs, twisting her foot until he heard "one almighty crack and the leg come loose, like." Cut into pieces, she fit nicely into the garbage bin.. That night after the remainder of his family was asleep, he buried Heather's body in the garden, where she lay undiscovered for seven years.. Fred & Rose West.

Seth Gitell considers the Beverly July Fourth parade and its Gloucester haterade and says it's just the latest proof that we're becoming a region divided by class:. ... One of the unique aspects of Eastern Massachusetts, unlike much of the country which is defined by brand new, nondescript, "subdivisions," is that the region still has cities and towns with unique identities. Also unlike other regions, such as the Southwest (Anglo v. Latino,) South (white v. African-American,) where divisions are primarily ethnic and racial, you're still dealing with towns, which have similar racial and ethnic profiles. Our area, therefore, provides a good litmus test on class. And it's ugly.. ... Free tagging:. Gloucester. Beverly. facebook. twitter. email. print. Ad:. Like the job UHub is doing?

Horribles parades - and Beverly is hardly the only place to have one - always do stuff like that. In fact, I saw a comment in some story about whatever Rhode Island town it is that has the July Fourth parade that Buddy Cianci always used to march/ride a horse in about how it would be terrible if he were in the parade this year, because then it would just be another Horribles parade (he marched anyway).. up.

Published: 03.22.2022. Durbin Questions Judge Jackson on the False, Debunked Claims Made by Senator Hawley. Judge Jackson confirms she imposes strict sentences and additional restraints when dealing with child pornography cases. WASHINGTON – U.S. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL), Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, today questioned Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, at the second day of the Senate Judiciary Committee’s hearing on her nomination to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. Durbin asked Judge Jackson about the false claims made by Senator Josh Hawley (R-MO), stating Judge Jackson “has a pattern of letting child pornography offenders off the hook for their appalling crimes.” But in each case Hawley cited, the offender went to prison, and in at least five of the seven cases, Jackson imposed a sentence at or above Probation’s recommendation. Various news outlets have debunked this offensive claim.. Durbin said, “I thought of these charges as I watched you and your family listening closely yesterday. It made me wonder how you felt as your friends and family heard those charges that your sentencing endanger[s] children. Could you tell us what was going through your mind at that point?”. Judge Jackson responded, “As a mother and a judge who has had to deal with these cases, I was thinking that nothing could be further from the truth. These are some of the most difficult cases that a judge has to deal with because we are talking about pictures of sex abuse of children. We are talking about graphic descriptions that judges have to read and consider when they decide how to sentence in these cases, and there is a statute that tells judges what they are supposed to do…The statute says ‘calculate the guidelines, but also look at various aspects of this offense, and impose a sentence that is ‘sufficient but not greater than necessary.’ When I am dealing with something like this, it is important to me to make sure that the children's perspective is represented in my sentencing…I impose a strict sentence and all of the additional restraints that are available in the law...I am imposing all of those constraints, because I understand how significant, how damaging, how horrible this crime is.”. Hawley claimed that Jackson had “a disturbing record” on child pornography. But Jackson’s sentences are in the judicial mainstream. As the Sentencing Commission concluded in its 2012 and 2021 reports, judges across the country consistently impose below-guidelines sentences in non-production cases due to a view that technological changes have rendered the guidelines outdated. For example, between 2015-2020: judges in the district of D.C., where Jackson served, imposed below-guidelines sentences in these cases 80% of the time; judges in Missouri district courts did so 77% of the time; and nationally, in 2019, only 30% of non-production child pornography offenders received a sentence within the guideline range.. Judge Jackson concluded, “Congress is tasked with the responsibility of setting penalties – [a] responsibility of setting penalties. Congress tells judges what to do when we sentence. Congress has to determine how it wishes for judges to handle these cases, but as it currently stands, the way the law’s written, the law is not consistent with the way these crimes are committed.”. A judge who Senator Hawley recommended for the Eastern District of Missouri, Sarah Pitlyk, in 2019 sentenced a person convicted of possessing child pornography to 60 months, well below the 135-168-month sentence recommended by the guidelines.. Hawley falsely claims that Judge Jackson “advocated for drastic change” in child pornography sentencing on the Sentencing Commission. But Hawley is referencing a bipartisan report that was issued on a unanimous basis by the Commission, including Republican appointee Dabney Friedrich, who was later nominated by Donald Trump and supported by every Senate Republican to be a district court judge.. Hawley also deliberately took remarks Judge Jackson made on the Sentencing Commission out of context, claiming that questions Judge Jackson asked about witnesses’ testimony were statements of her own opinions..

"A genocide is being perpetrated in Gaza in the name of the memory of the Holocaust," historian Enzo Traverso said.. Through the YouTube platform of the Geohistorical Observatory Channel “Coordinadas”, the Argentine intellectual Martin Martinelli conducted an interview with the Marxist historian Enzo Traverso focused on the analysis of the relations between Palestine and Israel. This interview is presented below:. RELATED:. Jordanian King Warns Against Any Scenario of Reoccupying Gaza. Our intention is to reflect from a historical point of view, as thinkers and activists in the relationship we have not from academia but from interacting with society. How do you think about what is happening right now in France and recently in London, regarding the conflict in Palestine and Israel?. It is a tragedy that affects us deeply, that has a global impact and no one can say that they are outside of this conflict.. It would be easier to say that Islamic fundamentalists, on the one hand, and a racist government, on the other hand, are facing each other. Put this way, we would have nothing to do with this madness and we can worry about other things. That attitude would be ethically and politically unacceptable, and it would also be blindness. Since no one is outside this conflict that has a global impact. So, we have the obligation to face this situation.. It is a tragedy, to a large extent, that no one was expecting because they were taken by surprise, but at the same time, reflecting on the context, it is a tragedy that is part of the long duration of this conflict, which are not meteorites that fall suddenly, but it was predictable.. No one knew how Hamas' attack on Israel would happen, but an eruption of the conflict was foreseeable. Then we must reflect on the causes of what happened, the dynamics of what is happening today within which we have to take into account the emotional impact. It is not the ideal time to analyze the situation, we need the necessary critical distance.. We must try to analyze events with rationality and critical distance, but we must consider the problem of how to act in response to this. We cannot just say: we are analysts without worrying about what to do at this moment. Afterwards, we can discuss the nature of the attack and response, as well as the nature of the war itself that started. It is a debate that we have to develop.. ������ ISRAELI PROPAGANDIST points to a random calendar at the Rantisi hospital as "evidence" of a "hostage keepers' list" with "terrorists' names".. �� But the ONLY thing on that "list" is literally the days of the week (Saturday-Friday).. pic.twitter.com/nti8zHqwSR. — Jackson Hinkle ���� (@jacksonhinklle) November 13, 2023. How do you see the large number of popular demonstrations that exist worldwide? And the role of the media, including social networks.. My first reaction was that of a citizen, an activist and a researcher who has a political commitment. It was the reaction of a leftist man.. It must be said clearly that there is some confusion on this issue. Let us be clear that the Hamas attack was a massacre and I have no difficulty expressing my condemnation of this. I rely on a principle of left-wing culture, in the broadest sense of the word, which establishes the relationship between the end and the means. If the goal is the emancipation or liberation of an oppressed people, there are means of action that are incompatible with the achievement of this goal.

PETA Makes Outrageous Connection Between Eating Chicken And Dick Size. JBried8 years ago. Taking the strategy of females across the world, PETA told TFM we should be concerned about our dick size. After we told them to suck it when tweeting about a news story that linked vegetarian diets to a higher risk of cancer, the organization let us know that a meat-eating diet had a far worse consequence: a small penis.. @totalfratmove You should probably take a look at this. https://t.co/NACu3M9hI6. — PETA (@peta) March 31, 2016. The tweet contained a link to their latest campaign video, which warns mothers about the dangers eating meat can have on the size of their son’s Johnson. The creepy as fuck PSA, titled “Eating Chicken Can Make Your Son’s Dick Small,” says phthalates, a group of chemicals used to make plastic, can be found in chicken.. Their data is from a 2008 study, which discussed the effects of the chemical in rodents.. What the video leaves out is that the study showed that the chemicals have “been measured in residential indoor environments in both house dust and indoor air” (cited directly from pdf above), making it pretty much inescapable.. The video states that “a recent study showed that a mother’s poultry consumption during pregnancy correlated with her kid’s penis size.” Once again, there seems to be a disconnect between cause and effect. Did you not pay attention in high school? Or ever? Correlation is not causation. Also, how was this tested? Did you hand-feed moms KFC and then whip out a ruler in the hospital?. My favorite part of this ad is that it is directed specifically at women. As a female, I can say that I have absolutely no concern about my future child’s penis size. Sure, I want the kid to succeed in life, but if it just so happens he isn’t the longest crayon in the box, I’ll be there to pat his back and remind him that size doesn’t matter..

Mississippi woman says restaurant manager caused a scene following her $150 tip to a waitress. According to Montgomery, the situation became even more distressing when the manager "made a scene" and pretended that the tip would not be accepted. Photo Credit: X/@_dawnmontgomery/Atlanta Black Star. Dawn Montgomery sparked an online controversy after stating that she and her group left a hefty tip for an Applebee’s waiter, prompting the restaurant’s manager to inquire about the amount.. Montgomery, upset and startled by the manager’s alleged conduct, took to social media to share her story. She stated that she was part of a group of 14 people who went to Applebee’s in Laurel, Mississippi, for dinner. At the venue, she said that she was told that her server, Melissa, was new and nervous about serving large parties. Despite Melissa’s initial concerns, Montgomery remarked that she performed an excellent job waiting at her table.. But when the grateful customer left a $150 tip, the manager showed up and informed her that the restaurant would have to check with corporate to be sure they could take such a large tip, which was out of the ordinary for Montgomery.. According to Montgomery, the situation became even more distressing when the manager “made a scene” and pretended that the tip would not be accepted. Montgomery said that before she could leave the restaurant, she had to give the manager her phone number and two signatures on the bill.. The Atlanta Black Star reported that her shared encounter shocked millions of viewers, who then tagged Applebee’s in search of clarification..

So WTF would those losers call Hillary Clinton, I can’t help but wonder?.

As the final portion of this blog-post states, the policy of unloading elderly hospital-patients into Covid-hot care-homes in order to clear the hospitals, had a lot to do with why 2020 saw a startling number of Covid-driven deaths.

I’m sorry, I garbled my wording in my previous comment a bit. What I was trying to get at in referring to the end of the blog-post is that this deadly policy was followed in many western countries. Many people consider Governor Cuomo of New York especially culpable in this regard. As far as partisan politics go, I think there’s plenty of blame to be spread around.

All three groups, the Indians, the Asians, and the middle easterners cite physical features as a reason for avoiding intermixing with black people.. (22 April 2017). Ruthie:.

As an atheist myself – militantly so, lately, because as you say, religion drives too many important social and cultural conversations – I would add one thought to your essay. From the point of view of the believers, who so often say that “God has a plan for everyone,” and “God decides who lives or dies,” couldn’t God have persuaded the woman not to have an abortion? Perhaps he wanted that soul in Heaven with him, and so the abortion is his plan for it.. I have a friend who, when he goes to a family funeral, wants to ask the sobbing mourners at church: “Why are you crying? He’s in Heaven now. Isnt’t that a good thing.”. But of course, “believers” don’t really believe in such nonsense. (N.B. I was raised Jewish, as were you I would guess, so of course, Heaven isn’t an option!). I doubt I’ll live to see the day when our culture grows up and stops believe in the adult version of Santa Claus. I can only..uh…pray that it will happen.. Cheers,. Harry Kloman.

It's been revealed that Deepika will play 'a razor-sharp huntress' in the film. Images Staff. 22 Jan, 2016. After bagging the Filmfare Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role (Female), Deepika is now looking to begin a new chapter in her career with her first Hollywood film, i.e., Vin Diesel's XXX: The Return of Xander Cage.. In the film, Deepika will play a a razor-sharp huntress who helps Cage during his latest mission, reports Variety.. While she admits that she's nervous about her big move, Deepika also talks about her Hollywood debut being a proud moment: "I feel proud to be a part of a film where I get to flaunt my ethnicity," she said to Filmfare. "The reason they are roping me is because of my ethnicity. I really hope that I do well in the movie and people go and watch it. ". Deepika announced the news of her casting last month via an ambiguous photo with Vin Diesel, which also led to a rather hilarious spoof..

While appreciating and congrats for such a project,Deepeka will surely be critized for flaunt displays by Indians.Although the Indian viewers pardon flaunts at Bollywood but it will be difficult to see their actress with alien Vin Diesel.And if if God forbid Deepeka appears to be extra bold flaunts,than must be prepared to face protests in India as well as slogans against her, because in India people are very much race,religion,caste,ethnic conxious.. Recommend. Satt Jan 22, 2016 07:26pm. @Historicevents You have never watched all the Indian cinema,flaunting and showing body in India is doesn't consider bad but flaunting wrong thing does,here in interview she said she will flaunt her ethnicity and race and this is not acceptable in India.You can show your beauty but can't say that I am beautiful because I am of certain race and ethnicity,In Indian culture every race and every ethnicity is beautiful..

Close Menu. Home. Download News App. Shop Here. Home. Download News App. Shop Here. WATCH: Gutfeld Exposes, Blasts Left’s “War on Women” Following Absurd Congressional Testimony. By will July 15, 2022 Commentary. Things got weird during a recent House hearing in which the president of the National Women’s Legal Center said, when asked if she could define the term “woman” that she identified as one and then, when pressed, that:. “I wonder, however, if in part the reason that you’re asking the question is that you’re trying to suggest that people who don’t identify as women can’t get pregnant.. “I think it’s actually really important to be very clear here, that there are people who identify as non-binary, I think about 5% of young people, who can be pregnant.”. The Republican Representative doing the questioning, Rep. Clyde of Georgia, hit back, saying:. “Okay. We’re not going to go there. I was hoping maybe you would say something that maybe we learned in high school biology.. “It has to do with X and Y chromosomes…which define male and female, but I guess we’re not going to get there.”. Well, Fox News’ almost always funny and spot-on Greg Gutfeld used that absurd incident, along with the resulting leftist freakout about the idea of pregnant men, to hit the left for being crazy and waging a war on women during his show.. Describing the form that the current war on women has taken, Gutfeld said:. “There’s not so much a war on women, it’s more like a persistent erosion. It’s creeping into science, language, courtrooms, restrooms, sports and the streets where you work. And you know it’s a problem when leading female achievers can no longer tell you what a woman or what a man is.”. Watch that here:. Further, giving an example of that war on women and the feminist groups refusing to stand up for women’s rights, Gutfeld said:. “Of course when female athletes complained about losing their spot to someone wearing a jockstrap and has a lung capacity of a blue whale, they are called transphobic. Enjoy your second, third, fourth place trophies, girls. Never mind that when she competed on the men’s team she was the the 505th competitor. Now she’s in the top ten.. “It’s funny how this only benefits male to female trans, not a lot of females who became males are winning in sports which may be another form of sexism. Again, where are the feminist groups? Are they okay with girl athletes getting crushed by athletes with a penis and muscle density of a pit bull?”. Then, joking about it and saying it’s time for men to start standing up for women, Gutfeld “mansplained”, making some jokes about sex stereotypes while calling out feminist groups for going “AWOL” on the topic of women’s rights, saying:. “How could I be a feminist? I admire chivalry. I am not angry. I’ve yet to burn a bra. Not intentionally. In this crazy time it seems like it’s time for someone to take the lead defending women since the feminist groups have gone awol.. “Ladies, follow me. If I don’t ask for directions along the way that’s how dudes roll. So allow me to man-’s plane. There is not so much a war on women, it’s like a persistent erosion. It’s creeping into science, language, court rooms, restroom sports industry. You know it’s a problem when leading female achievers can no longer tell you what a woman or a man is.”. The left, meanwhile, has not stepped up to protect the rights of women. Instead, it has continued to fight for the right of men to say that they are pregnant, has fought to send men that identify as women to women’s prisons and shelters, and has pushed puberty blockers on kids.. The new “feminists” are making the “77 cents for every dollar a man makes” people seem sane, logical, and reasonable at this point.. By: Gen Z Conservative, editor of GenZConservative.com.

Norman Siebrasse: Why this B.C. court decision proves it’s time to routinely use the notwithstanding clause. Commentary 9 February 2024. Norman Siebrasse. View bio. 09 Feb 24. British Columbia has been wrestling with the problem of public drug abuse for years. It has pioneered innovative programs such as supervised consumption sites where addicts can safely use illegal drugs. But striking the right balance between helping drug addicts and creating a safe livable city has proven to be a very difficult problem.. A recent Act tried to fine-tune the current approach by preventing drug users from using fentanyl and other illegal drugs in public parks. This might seem fairly uncontroversial, and yet, in a recent decision, Chief Justice Hinkson of the Supreme Court of British Columbia granted an order preventing the Act from coming into effect until the end of March, on the basis that it was arguably a Charter violation. The decision is shocking. How could it possibly be unconstitutional to stop people from using fentanyl in public parks? The implications are even more shocking. We need to get into the weeds of the law to see where the problem lies.. The federal Controlled Drugs and Substances Act makes it illegal to possess or traffic drugs such as fentanyl. The Act provides that the federal minister of Health may grant exemptions. As part of its strategy to address drug abuse, at the beginning of last year, British Columbia got an exemption from the Act to decriminalize possession of small quantities of certain drugs, including fentanyl. The exemption did not apply to certain listed premises, such as K-12 schools, skate parks, or wading pools. Last fall, after most of a year’s experience with the exemption, the province passed the Restricting Public Consumption of Illegal Substances Act. Its main effect is to fine-tune the exemption, by adding public parks, beaches, and sports fields to the list of places where illegal drugs cannot be used.. But the Act doesn’t actually make it a crime to possess drugs in public parks. If someone is using drugs in a public park, the Act authorizes the police to ask the drug user to stop using drugs or leave. It is only an offence if the drug user refuses to leave when asked. If the drug user refuses to leave or stop using drugs when asked, then the police officer may seize the drugs.. To recap, if a police officer comes across someone using fentanyl in a public park, the Act allows the officer to ask the drug user to stop using and leave. That is what Chief Justice Hinkson held is potentially unconstitutional. The direct implication of the decision is that there is arguably a Charter right to use fentanyl in public parks. If that seems crazy, it is. So let me back up my assertion.. In his brief discussion of the Charter breach, Hinkson CJ began by noting that a law that prevents access to health care makes out a deprivation of the right to security.. 1. [50] But this Act clearly does not directly prevent access to health care, so this is a bit mysterious. He then said that the real harm is “by directing [drug users] and those who care from them away from public places, there is a prescient risk that the Act will push [drug users] further from health services and deprive accesses thereto.”. 2. [50]. How does asking drug users to leave a park while	None	None	None	None	Topical	SelfInfl/	"<|im_sep|><Reasoning>

A blog about beauty, lifestyle, and inspiration etc.. Tuesday, August 13, 2019. Mental Health Check-In. Hello Everyone!. After last months ER visit for anxiety and depression. I had to acknowledge that I wasn't feeling okay. Last month was a wake up call. I didn't like seeing my blood pressure so high because of anxiety. I'm still struggling with anxiety and depression, but I take everyday with patience and better self care. I know that I said I'm taking a small break, which I am. I wanted to update everyone on how I'm doing. I'm still not doing well as I want to, but I'm not in an Emergency Room. I think this time dealing with anxiety and depression is worse because of letting things bottle upside. I guess it was just a matter of time before I felt like I was crashing. I can't thank you all enough for all of your well wishes.. I had so many triggers last month leading to me feeling like I was falling to pieces. I haven't felt like I did a few weeks ago in over 3 years. I'm working on not letting my triggers overwhelm me.. Since I've been in this depressive state I had a tendency to overindulge in Krispy Kreme Glazed Donuts. Time to put those glazed donuts away and get back to my exercise routine. Since it's so hot and humid all day I doubt if I'll be walking outside. I'll probably go to the mall and walk. I want to get back into cardio as well.. I had no plans to stop going to counseling, but right now I need counseling. I usually space my appointments, but I think I might start going every two weeks. I think talking about my feelings is healthy and therapeutic. Talking helps me keep things into perspective.. I've been on medication for depression and anxiety off and on for about 10 years. I started taking antidepressants again last year. I've noticed that medication does help, but I have to learn to balance my life better. I will talk with you all soon.

Psychiatric & Neurological Disorders. Substance use disorder. Substance use disorder (SUD) is a complex condition involving the uncontrolled use of a substance, despite harmful consequences. Learn more about substance use disorders including the symptoms, and how they can be managed and treated.. What is substance use disorder?. A substance use disorder (SUD) occurs when someone loses the ability to control their use of a substance such as drugs, medication, alcohol or tobacco, causing harm to themselves or others. These substances activate the brain’s reward system, producing pleasurable feelings, which can lead to intense cravings. A substance use disorder can result in a person being unable to function normally day-to-day.. What are the main types of substance use disorder?. Substance use disorders are diagnosed based on the primary substance being misused. There are two main types of substance use disorder:. Alcohol use disorder: Alcohol is one of the most commonly used intoxicating substances. When someone misuses alcohol (often referred to as alcoholism) they lose control over how much alcohol they consume. They may also experience withdrawal symptoms when they are not drinking. Alcoholism can cause serious health conditions and may result in damage to organs in the body including the liver, heart, or the brain. Alcohol use disorder can also lead to destructive behaviour and unintended consequences, including family disputes, violence, accidents and injuries, unsafe sex, loss of personal possessions (e.g. wallet, handbag, mobile phone, and money), drunk driving, and absences from work or education.. Drug use disorder: Often referred to as drug addiction, this is a chronic condition that is difficult to control. When someone is addicted to drugs, they cannot resist the urge to use them, no matter how much damage they may cause. Drug addiction may include illegal drugs, but it can also involve prescription medications or a combination of both. Drugs such as cocaine, heroin, methamphetamines, benzodiazepines, steroids, and inhalants are highly addictive. They can lead to a substance use disorder very quickly. Drug addiction leads to changes to the brain over time which can make it very difficult to resist the intense urges to take drugs. That is why people who are addicted to drugs may relapse when they have tried to stop. Drug use disorder can have a devastating effect on people’s lives, leading to relationship problems, poor work or academic performance, issues with personal hygiene, increased impulsivity and risk-taking, and loss of interest in hobbies and activities.. How many people have substance use disorders?. Alcohol consumption is responsible for three million deaths each year globally, according to the World Health Organization. Overall, alcohol use disorders are responsible for 5.1% of the global burden of disease. Alcohol is the main risk factor for premature mortality and disability among people aged 15-49, accounting for 10% of all deaths in this age group.. The World Health Organization reports that about 270 million people (or about 5.5% of the global population aged 15-64) used psychoactive drugs in the previous year and about 35 million people are estimated to have drug use disorders. It is estimated that about half a million deaths every year are due to drug use, equating to 350,000 male deaths and 150,000 female deaths.. Symptoms. The symptoms of substance use disorders vary from person to person and can also depend on the type of addiction.. What are the symptoms of substance use disorder?. There are several signs and symptoms of substance use disorder that are common to most types of addiction. These include:. Behavioural and social changes:. Secretive or dishonest behaviour.

Watch on YouTube: "Prices at the Pumps - July 24, 2024 #saltwire #pricesatthepumps #gasprices #fuel #canada #update". Watch on. By Andrew Chung. (Reuters) - Students at Indiana University on Friday asked the U.S. Supreme Court to block the school's requirement that they be vaccinated against COVID-19 in an early test of vaccine mandates amid a spike in infections and hospitalizations caused by the Delta variant.. The students filed an emergency request with the justices after lower courts rejected their bid for an injunction against the vaccine mandate while litigation continues.. Related stories. Beginning this fall, the university requires that students be vaccinated unless they qualify for a religious or medical exemption. Those granted exceptions would be required to wear face masks and be tested twice weekly.. Eight students sued in June, contending that the mandate violates their right to "bodily integrity" and due process under the U.S. Constitution's 14th Amendment.. The university "is treating its students as children who cannot be trusted to make mature decisions," the students said in Friday's filing, requesting that the justices act by Aug. 13.. COVID-19 vaccines have become a political flashpoint in the United States as the highly contagious Delta variant is hitting states with lower vaccination rates particularly hard.. Hundreds of colleges and universities have already mandated the COVID-19 vaccine, as have some private employers. The students' case presents one of the first challenges to the legality of these mandates.. In July, U.S. District Court Judge Damon Leichty in South Bend, Indiana, rebuffed the students, finding that the university's policy "isn't forced vaccination.". On Aug. 2 the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals also refused to bar the mandate, noting that "vaccination requirements, like other public-health measures, have been common in this nation.". The appeals court added: "A university will have trouble operating when each student fears that everyone else may be spreading disease.". (Reporting by Andrew Chung; Editing by Mark Potter).

With ‘Food Safety’ being the theme of this year’s World Health Day on April 7, 37 laureates of the Right Livelihood Award from across the world have endorsed a declaration on the future of nutrition, denouncing Golden Rice and Genetically Modified Bananas as ‘false miracles’ to achieving food security. Golden Rice is a genetically engineered rice variety offered by GM proponents as a cure for Vitamin A Deficiency (VAD), while GM bananas are proposed to compensate for a lack of Vitamin A and iron.. The declaration, written by 1993 Right Livelihoood Award recipient Vandana Shiva and a coalition of women’s groups in India, comes as controversy escalates over the development of GM crops in Africa. According to a February 2015 report by Friends of the Earth International only four African countries, South Africa, Egypt, Burkina Faso and Sudan, have released GM crops commercially, while others are involved in testing or have placed bans and restrictions on GM crops and commodities. A GM banana project in Uganda under the National Agricultural Research Institute and supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation recently provoked fierce resistance from local civil society organizations who claim that there are better alternatives to GM.. Food sovereignty organisation GRAIN, recipient of the 2011 Right Livelihood Award and signatory to the declaration, said in an earlier statement, “Vitamin A deficiency (VAD) – like other problems on malnutrition and hunger – is not caused by the lack of Vitamin A in food, but by people’s inability to access a balanced diet…it is a mistake to turn blindly to Golden Rice, a crop that the International Rice Research Institute itself admits it has not yet determined can actually improve Vitamin A…It is clear that the development of Golden Rice, with its avowedly humanitarian mission to solve Vitamin A deficiency serves the biotech industry in its efforts to win wider approval for GM foods. It is a tool to promote GMOs that would pave the way towards control of food and agriculture by agrobiotech corporations.”. Nigerian environmentalist Nnimmo Bassey and recipient of the 2010 Right Livelihood Award, said the move toward GM crops on the continent is driven by profit and heralds a new form of colonization. “The modern biotech industry is really going bananas. The so-called golden rice has always been known to be a hoax. The same goes for the so-called golden bananas. The future of African nutrition and access to the right food lies in the preservation of our biodiversity and genetic resources,” he said.. The declaration states that Golden Rice has not in fact proven to be more nutritious than indigenous varieties and that natural food sources like turmeric provide much more iron than GM bananas.. “As a source of nutrition for the Global South, Golden Rice has no real benefits. But considering the precedents set by soya, corn, canola and cotton, introducing Golden Rice as a way for large companies to gain control over entire food cultures based on rice, makes perfect sense,” states the declaration. It also reveals the environmental costs, potentially damaging health impacts and consequences for small-scale farmers of GM crop production, and calls for support for sustainable agro-ecology systems with crop diversity and seed sovereignty..

Jewish community. Published in. Interviews. Features. Columns. Editing & commissioning. Magazine. Comment editor. News editor. Contact. Jenni Frazer. Dweck: the ruling. For the Jewish News published July 21 2017. Rabbi Joseph Dweck, Senior Rabbi of the S&P Sephardi Community, has held on to his job after a ruling by Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis’s review committee.. But Rabbi Dweck has had to pay a high price — he has had to relinquish being a dayan on the Sephardi Beth Din, and to agree to submit the contents of his public lectures to a member of the review committee. He has also agreed not to return to his former congregation in New Jersey to be a summer scholar-in-residence, as he has done for the past three years.. Rabbi Dweck gave a controversial lecture on homosexuality and Jewish teaching in May. Two weeks after his lecture, he was furiously attacked by Rabbi Aharon Bassous of the Golders Green Sephardi congregation, Kehillat Yehezkel.. Rabbi Bassous took issue with many of Rabbi Dweck’s other halachic rulings, and complained that he had challenged the teachings of other rabbis.. In the wake of Rabbi Bassous’s attack on Rabbi Dweck, Orthodox rabbis worldwide weighed in with their opinions, some supportive of the American-born rabbi, some fiercely critical.. The turning-point came when the Sephardi Chief Rabbi of Israel, known as the Rishon l’Zion, Rabbi Yitzhak Yosef, wrote to rabbis from the Syrian community in New York for which Rabbi Dweck had worked before coming to London.. Rabbi Yosef — who is related to Rabbi Dweck’s wife, Margalit — told the Syrian rabbis that Rabbi Dweck was “not qualified” to be a rabbi and urged his former colleagues to dissociate themselves from him.. This was followed by a swingeing attack on Rabbi Dweck by the Gateshead Rav, Rabbi Shraga Feivel Zimmerman, and by 60 anonymous rabbis who wrote an open letter to Chief Rabbi Mirvis warning him that he would “split Anglo-Jewry” if he did not ensure that Rabbi Dweck lost his job.. An attempt by the Rishon l’Zion to persuade Dayan Lichtenstein, of the Federation Beth Din, to assemble a Beth Din to “try” Rabbi Dweck, failed. Chief Rabbi Mirvis said firmly that he would have nothing to do with such a “kangaroo court’.. However, when the Rishon l’Zion gave his blessing to Chief Rabbi Mirvis solving the problem by whatever method he chose, the way was clear for the British chief rabbi to put together a review committee.. It comprised three of the most eminent Torah leaders of Anglo Jewry – Dayan Chanoch Ehrentreu, Dayan Menachem Gelley and Dayan Abraham David. Additionally, in the interests of what the Chief Rabbi’s Office called “natural justice”, the QC, Professor Julian Lew, attended the deliberations.. The committee noted Rabbi Dweck’s “sincere contrition” and praised his work as an inspirational rabbi of the Sephardi community since his arrival in London.. But it also observed that “Rabbi Dweck readily acknowledged that he had not always issued halachic rulings in a responsible manner and at times incorrectly. In particular, he recognised that in the course of a wide range of his teachings, he had cited rabbinic sources and views on halacha [Jewish law] out of proper context and he had cited halachic rulings and hashkafa [Jewish world view] in a way which may have misled those listening. Rabbi Dweck also expressed a deep sense of regret over his inappropriate comments about sayings of the Sages and derogatory comments about rabbis”.. It is understood that more than 30 rabbis attended a meeting at Chief Rabbi Mirvis’s home on Tuesday to be briefed about the decision of the review committee. The Rishon l’Zion has been kept informed and Rabbi Dweck himself, describing the whole furore as “a painful experience” not only personally, but for his wife and family, has issued a statement expressing regret that “there were instances where I spoke in a fashion that was inappropriate and imprudent”.. But he, his congregation, and Chief Rabbi Mirvis himself, have deprecated the personal nature of the attacks against him.. Rabbi Dweck said: “Whilst some of the criticism was justified, the vitriolic tone and ad hominem nature of some of the attacks made substantive engagement with the issues all but impossible”. Sabah Zubaida, the parnas presidente of the S&P Sephardi Community, which broadly supported Rabbi Dweck, said that the rabbi had “been subjected to a series of regrettable personal attacks that went well beyond any reasonable dispute on issues of approach to Jewish law”. The congregation welcomed the ruling and described Rabbi Dweck as “a truly inspirational leader for us”.. Chief Rabbi Mirvis said he had been “appalled by some of the conduct we have witnessed	Topical	Topical	None	None	None	Hate/Ideologi/	"<|im_sep|><Reasoning>

Published August 4, 2020 at 5:11 PM EDT. Facebook. Twitter. LinkedIn. Email. Jewel Samad / AFP via Getty Images. Some 1,892 American flags are installed on the National Mall in Washington, DC in 2014. The Iraq and Afghanistan veterans installed the flags to represent the 1,892 veterans and service members who committed suicide this year as part of the "We've Got Your Back: IAVA's Campaign to Combat Suicide.". This summer the Trump administration rolled out the President's Roadmap to Empower Veterans and End a National Tragedy of Suicide (PREVENTS) - a long awaited strategy to bring down the rate of suicide in the military and among civilians. It focuses on enlisting community partners and a public awareness campaign to fight the stigma around seeking help during a mental health crisis.. Critics in congress have said the plan isn't proactive enough. But it does address one issue that has been seen as politically taboo: access to guns.. Suicide is notoriously difficult to study since it's a rare event, even as suicide rates for the military and civilians are on the rise. But if there's one obvious place to fight veterans' suicide, it's firearms. Gun owners are four times more likely to die by suicide. Veterans are almost twice as likely to be gun owners, and one study showed that one in three vets store their guns loaded and unlocked. Guns are by far the deadliest method of suicide.. But keeping guns away from veterans has been politically radioactive.. "People really haven't wanted to touch the issue of firearms safety," said Terri Tanielian, a senior behavioral scientist at the RAND corporation.. She says the new White House roadmap was a bit disappointing - it took 15 months to endorse a set of recommendations that aren't very new.. But she is happy that the White House plan mentioned "safe storage" of guns. There had been rumors that the powerful gun-rights lobby would get that section removed from the plan.. "Now that we're wading into that water, it is good to see that we are willing to talk about it and engage partners and do something meaningfully on this issue," Tanielian said..

Home. News. Videos. Resources. About. Donations. Contact. Citizens Commission on Human Rights. National Affairs Office. Washington, DC. FDA Updates Warning on Stimulants Prescribed for ADHD, Now Lists Risks of Misuse, Addiction, Diversion and Overdose. by CCHR National Affairs Office | May 18, 2023. New warning cites high potentital for abuse and misuse of ADHD drugs that can lead to addiction, overdose, and death.. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is requiring new warnings in the prescribing information for stimulant drugs used to treat so-called attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) “to address continuing concerns of misuse, abuse, addiction, and overdose of the prescription drugs,” according to the FDA’s statement on the change. The “boxed warning” being updated is the most prominent warning the FDA can require for drugs.. Stimulants commonly prescribed for ADHD that will now carry the elevated warning include Adderall, Concerta, Dexedrine, and Ritalin. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) classifies these drugs as Schedule II controlled substances – the same drug classification as for cocaine, morphine, oxycodone, and fentanyl. The DEA warns that use of stimulant drugs can lead to “severe psychological or physical dependence” and that “these drugs are also considered dangerous.” Diversion of the drugs is illegal.. The FDA’s new warning for stimulants used to treat ADHD cites the drugs’ high potential for abuse and misuse, which can lead to the development of a substance use disorder, including addiction.. In explaining its reason for the heightened warning, the FDA states, “The current prescribing information for some prescription stimulants does not provide up to date warnings about the harms of misuse and abuse, and particularly that most individuals who misuse prescription stimulants get their drugs from other family members or peers.”. Diversion of prescribed stimulant drugs from patients to others is a longstanding problem, particularly among children and young adults. Research has found that a range of 16% to 29% of students from grade school through college who have stimulant prescriptions are asked to give, sell, or trade their medications.. “To address continuing concerns of misuse, abuse, addiction, and overdose of prescription stimulants, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is requiring updates to the Boxed Warning.”. — U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA’s new warning reads, in part: “WARNING: ABUSE, MISUSE, AND ADDICTION. [Name of drug] has a high potential for abuse and misuse, which can lead to the development of a substance use disorder, including addiction. Misuse and abuse of CNS [central nervous system] stimulants, including [Name of drug], can result in overdose and death.”. The latest figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) show that overdose deaths from stimulant drugs have tripled from 10,255 deaths in 2017 to 32,478 in 2022. This increase is occurring in the context of a national overdose crisis, in which stimulants are increasingly involved, according to the CDC.. Overdose deaths from stimulant drugs tripled from 2017 to 2022, with stimulants increasingly involved in the national overdose crisis.. The FDA’s communication lists serious side effects of stimulant drugs that require emergency treatment, including fast heart rate, fast breathing, increased blood pressure, restlessness, tremors, loss of coordination, nausea and vomiting, aggressive behavior, panic, confusion, and hallucinations. Stimulants are also linked to stunted growth in children.. Some 9.6 million Americans are prescribed stimulant drugs for so-called ADHD. However, there is no objective, scientific basis for “diagnoses” of mental disorders, as acknowledged by Thomas Insel, M.D., former director of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), in his blog on the NIMH website in 2013. This means it is far too easy to “diagnose” ADHD.. The late psychologist Keith Conners conducted the first formal trials on the now-widely prescribed ADHD stimulant methylphenidate, commonly sold under the brand names Ritalin and Concerta. He later realized that ADHD diagnoses were out of control and called ADHD misdiagnoses “a national disaster of dangerous proportions.”. Beyond the risks of serious adverse effects, a recent study found no convincing evidence of any long-term benefit to children from treatment for ADHD with stimulant drugs.. One in three Americans taking ADHD drugs is under the age of 18, but research has raised concerns over prescribing stimulants to children. Beyond the risks of serious adverse effects, a recent study found no convincing evidence of any long-term benefit to children from treatment for ADHD with stimulant drugs.. Another recent study found that children started on ADHD treatment with methylphenidate were 18 times more likely to experience depression than before starting, and when the drug was discontinued, the higher risk dropped back to starting levels.. Children who were first prescribed methylphenidate between the ages of 6 and 8 and continued to take the drugs had a	None	None	None	None	Topical	SelfInfl/	"<|im_sep|><Reasoning>

https://turks.us/government-spyware-is-another-reason-to-use-an-ad-blocker-techcrunch/	eng	Government spyware is another reason to use an ad blocker | TechCrunch - Daily News World News Turkish Turkey. Skip to content. News. World. Finance. Politics. Real Estate. Sports. Technology. Entertainment. Technology. Government spyware is another reason to use an ad blocker | TechCrunch. April 13, 2024 admin-dominor. Ad blockers might seem like an unlikely defense in the fight against spyware, but new reporting casts fresh light on how spyware makers are weaponizing online ads to allow governments to conduct surveillance.. Spyware makers are reportedly capable of locating and stealthily infecting specific targets with spyware using banner ads.. One of the startups that worked on an ad-based spyware infection system is Intellexa, a European company that develops the Predator spyware. Predator is able to access the full contents of a target’s phone in real time.. According to documents seen by Israeli news outlet Haaretz, Intellexa presented a proof-of-concept system in 2022 called Aladdin that enabled the planting of phone spyware through online ads. The documents included a demo of the Aladdin system with technical explanations on how the spyware infects its targets and examples of malicious ads: by “seemingly targeting graphic designers and activists with job offers, through which the spyware will be introduced to their device,” Haaretz reported.. It’s unclear if Aladdin was fully developed or was sold to government customers.. Another private Israeli company called Insanet succeeded in developing an ad-based infection system capable of locating an individual within an advertising network, Haaretz revealed last year.. Online ads help website owners, including this one, generate revenue. But online ad exchanges can be abused to push malicious code to a target’s device.. Delivering malware through malicious ads, often referred to as malvertising, works by injecting malicious code into the ads displayed on websites on computer and phone browsers. Much of these attacks rely on some interaction with the victim, such as tapping a link or opening a malicious file.. But the global ubiquity of online advertising vastly increases the reach that government customers have to target individuals — including their critics — with stealthy spyware.. While no phone or computer can ever be completely unhackable, ad blockers can be effective in stopping malvertising and ad-based malware before it ever hits the browser.. Ad blockers — as the name suggests — prevent ads from displaying in web browsers. Ad blockers don’t just hide the ads, but rather block the underlying website from loading the ads to begin with. That’s also good for privacy, since it means ad exchanges cannot use tracking code to see which sites users visit as they browse the web. Ad-blocking software is available for phones, as well.. Security experts have long advised using an ad blocker to prevent malvertising attacks. In 2022, the FBI said in a public service announcement to use an ad blocker as an online safety precaution.. “Everyone should block ads,” tweeted John Scott-Railton, a Citizen Lab senior researcher who has investigated government spyware, in response to the Haaretz report. “It’s a matter of safety.”.

Harare pastor, NRZ battle over US$2m property takes another twist. Kana Ndanyura hits 2 million views in 4 weeks. Hamas leader Marwan Issa died in an Israeli air strike, White House official Jake Sullivan has said.. As deputy military commander, Marwan Issa would be Hamas’s most senior leader to die since the war began on 7 October.. The Palestinian group, which controls Gaza, has not officially commented on reports of his death.. Israeli media sources have reported that Mr Issa was killed in a strike on a tunnel complex under the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza last week.. The deputy commander of Hamas’s military wing – the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, was considered one of Israel’s most-wanted men. The European Union, which placed the Hamas leader on its terrorist blacklist, linked him directly to the 7 October attack led by the group which killed approximately 1,200 people.. He had been jailed by Israel for five years during the first Palestinian intifada, or uprising, and detained by the Palestinian Authority in 1997 until the start of the second intifada in 2000.. Marwan Issa – biography. Marwan Abdel Karim Ali Issa, also known as the “Shadow Man” and the kunya Abu Baraa, was a Palestinian militant. As the deputy commander of Hamas’ military wing, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, he was the right-hand man to Mohammed Deif and played a significant role in planning the 2023 Hamas attack on Israel.. Born: 1965, Gaza Strip. Died: March 2024 (age 59 years), Nuseirat Camp. The Israeli military has killed a number of Hamas’s senior leaders since 7 October. Hamas political leader Saleh al-Arouri died in an explosion in Beirut’s southern suburb of Dahiyeh. Israel is widely considered responsible for that attack.. Mr Sullivan, the White House’s national security adviser, said other Hamas leaders were believed to be in hiding, “likely deep in the Hamas tunnel network” in Gaza.. He pledged that the US would aid Israel in its continued hunt for top Hamas leaders, adding: “Justice will come for them, too.”. But he also emphasised that US President Joe Biden had expressed his growing alarm over the rising number of civilian deaths in Gaza in a call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu – their first conversation in a month.. The US president reiterated his commitment to Israel and its “right to go after Hamas”, according to Mr Sullivan, but he also said that it would be a “mistake” for Israel’s military to invade Rafah – a city in southern Gaza where an estimated million refugees have fled to during the war.. The invasion “would lead to more innocent civilian deaths, worsen the already dire humanitarian crisis, deepen the anarchy in Gaza and further isolate Israel internationally”, the US national security adviser told reporters.. More than 31,000 Palestinian civilians have died since the war started on 7 October, according to the Hamas-led health ministry in Gaza. The death toll has drawn international condemnation and alienated many of Israel’s allies.. President Biden pushed Mr Netanyahu for a “clear, strategic end game” in Gaza during the call, Mr Sullivan said.. “The president told the prime minister again today that we share the goal of defeating Hamas, but we just believe you need a coherent and sustainable strategy to make that happen,” he said.. Mr Biden was able to get the Israeli leader to agree to sending a “senior interagency team composed of military, intelligence and humanitarian officials” to Washington in the coming days to discuss US concerns over an invasion of Rafah.. The expectation is that Israel will delay its assault until that meeting is held, Mr Sullivan said.. Mr Netanyahu confirmed the call on X, formerly Twitter, and said the two had “discussed the latest developments in the war” as well as Israel’s goals in the conflict..

Lawsuit against Monsanto filed for damages to the environment with PCBs. By Saying Truth. December 12, 2016. 0. 82. Facebook. Twitter. Pinterest. WhatsApp. Telegram. Polychlorinated biphenyls commonly known as PCBs were produced in America by a single company during 1935 to 1979 before it was banned by the government. The popular agriculture company Monsanto has been a lot of controversies before. PCB is one of them. They were the only producers and as per the latest lawsuit filed against them, the company continued producing PCB despite the fact that it is a harmful chemical.. Source Image. Washington State has now filed an environmental lawsuit against the company and seeks damages and cleanup cost associated with PCB. Attorney General Bob Ferguson said in his statement that it was ethically wrong on Monsanto’s part not to stop the production even though they knew PCB will have an adverse effect on the environment..

Overall Customer Service : Good. Review Description. They picked up the car on Friday with only a few problems. They told me they'd be there around 10-11 am so my fiance stayed home from work to be there and they didn't show up until almost 2 pm so that was a little annoying but definitely understandable given the people we were dealing with (non-educated and incredibly rude). Where my frustration came in was on Saturday. I got a call around 2:45 pm CST from a guy who could barely speak English. He said he would be in Branford, CT Sunday morning by 10 am. I clarified with him that it was the following Sunday (9/30) like you and I agreed. He said no, it was yesterday (9/23). I immediately started to get upset knowing that you told me to stop worrying and you guys do this all the time and that was far from what was happening. Every concern I had was now coming to fruition. I told the driver (or attempted to with his broken English) that we would not be there and he'd have to wait until next Sunday (9/30) to deliver. He hung up on me and then about an hour later I get a call from his dispatcher. He tells me that if they cannot deliver by 11 am, that he will bring the car to Springfield, MA and we'd have to pick it up there. Where our house is is a good 2 hour drive to Springfield! Trying to be polite, I was getting irate that I was the one being inconvenienced for something that wasn't my fault. To make a long story short, he told me to call someone in the area and have them get the car. I said that isn't my responsibility as I paid for a service that they were not coming through on. So here I was calling my Mom asking for her to help get $500 cash and to have the guy deliver the car to her on Sunday. To no shock, she didn't have $500 cash on her and now that it was almost 5 pm EST on a Saturday, every bank was closed and wouldn't be open until Monday. So she had to call my Dad (her ex) to ask for his help as well. Your company/broker company put me in a VERY difficult spot and an extremely awkward one. After I called the dispatcher back, he said that if the car wasn't delivered by 12 noon, he was bringing it to Springfield, MA. I asked him to please work with me as I was already going out of my way to work with him when I should've had no obligations to. My Mom had plans until 4 pm and wouldn't be around to accept the car until then. He finally worked with me after a 3rd phone call to him and the car was delivered yesterday. I do not know of any body damage issues but I won't be able to check that out until we arrive this Saturday, 9/29. The delivery guy was a complete jerk to my Dad yesterday and demanded that my Dad drive him back to his truck after he was a jerk dropping off the money. Just simply an awful experience all thanks to the companies that State 2 State brokers with. I just want others to know that when JP at State 2 State says not to worry and he does this all the time, you still have every right to worry..

Research updates. About the project. Participating countries. Contact. Global Kids Online. Research updates. Start of the pilot research in the Philippines. 27th October 2016. The Global Kids Online Philippines project was carried out by the University of the Philippines, Manila and focused on in-depth understanding of children’s online experiences, looking both at the risks and opportunities and their impact on child well-being. This report presents the findings from the pilot study.. The Philippines is one of the 17 countries in the UNICEF Global Programme to protect children from online sexual exploitation and in a recent publication (UNICEF, 2016) the country was described as ‘the global epicentre of the live-stream sexual abuse trade’. Driven by poverty, particularly deprived areas become ‘hotspots’ for the international trade in live-stream child sexual abuse. Child sexual abuse materials were made illegal in the Philippines only in 2009 and the legal protection and prosecution framework remains insufficient. With the age of consent still 12 years of age, the country continues to face challenges in protecting vulnerable children and prosecuting their abusers.. As part of its campaign for a holistic approach to tackling child sexual exploitation online, UNICEF funded a two-phase National Study of Online Sexual Exploitation and Abuse in the Philippines. The first phase of the study led by Anna Lena Lopez (University of the Philippines, Manila) looks at the challenges faced in four different areas: (1) the private sector, focusing particularly on the financial and telecommunication industry; (2) different agencies involved in tackling child sexual exploitation, such as the police, law-enforcement agencies, courts, and social workers; (3) cases of abused children accessed via the database of Child protection units; (4) perpetrators of child online sexual exploitation and abuse who have been convicted. This study aims to map ways of creating a more efficient and holistic approach to tackling child sexual exploitation online and to identify gaps in capacity and the need for further support.. The second phase of the study led by Merle Tan (University of the Philippines, Manila) is part of the Global Kids Online project and focuses on in-depth understanding of children’s online experiences, looking both at the risks and opportunities and their impact on child well-being.. Using the lessons learned from the Philippian context, the Global Kids Online team and a group of experts developed a survey module on child sexual exploitation and abuse which was tested during the pilot fieldwork. It aims to explore both the incidence and effects of one sexual exploitation and abuse on children’s well-being.. Executive summary. Further materials from this study:.

For instance, the rehab process for a drug addict may be different from the rehab process designed for an alcohol addict person. Usually, individuals who have been in addiction to drugs for years require a more intensive treatment process as compared to the individuals who have been involved in drugs for a shorter period of time. So the drug rehab process may take months or days according to the level of addiction. Here you can read about the drug rehab process and options for drug addiction treatment.. How to Get Started?.

Depending on the addiction type, different services are offered through different treatment facilities. Some of those may be providing detox treatment which means they work on the causes of addiction for treatment. The others may be providing outpatient therapy treatment facilities for specific kinds of additions. So you need to be sensible for how to choose the right rehabilitation center that is suitable to the addiction type and level of severity it is in. better to go to an addiction rehab center that has the capability to provide a full range of treatment for the type of addiction you or your loved one has.. For instance, for the patients addicted to alcohol or opioids, choose a center that provides medication-assisted treatment too to improve the rehab process. This process is specific to alcohol addicts only. Also, make sure the rehab center and its facilities must be licensed.. How to Get Admission?. Once you make sure the center provides good quality drug rehab process facilities and the type of treatment you or your loved one require, take no time to approach them. They may ask different questions about the patient’s past and current mental, psychological and medical history, a remarkable incident/accident the patient has been going through, medical or health providers they have been visiting, and many more. So be prepared for a list of such questions they may ask you to simplify the drug rehab process. Other important things they may ask about can be the type of drug used, mental illness or disorders if any, living habits, living environment, family and relationship conditions, social support system, financial information, etc. You should also ask them if you have any questions about the type of treatment, plan, facilities available, cost, rules, and expectations regarding the drug rehab process..

(CNN Español) — El pleno de la Asamblea Nacional de Ecuador rechazó este viernes la solicitud enviada por la Corte…. Listen now to WTOP News WTOP.com | Alexa | Google Home | WTOP App | 103.5 FM. (CNN Español) — El pleno de la Asamblea Nacional de Ecuador rechazó este viernes la solicitud enviada por la Corte Nacional de Justicia que pedía autorizar el procesamiento penal de la vicepresidenta de la República, Verónica Abad, por su presunta participación en el delito de concusión.. No hubo los 92 votos necesarios para que el parlamento diera luz verde al enjuiciamiento penal, requerimiento legal necesario para los dignatarios ecuatorianos que gozan de fuero de Corte.. Durante la sesión convocada la tarde de este viernes, la Asamblea aprobó por mayoría una moción de la asambleísta Gissella Molina Álvarez para que se rechazara la petición judicial. La moción se aprobó con 75 votos a favor, 38 en contra y 20 abstenciones.. Estos son los escenarios si la Asamblea Nacional de Ecuador autoriza proceso penal por posible concusión contra la vicepresidenta Abad. Esta decisión frena la solicitud de la jueza Daniela Camacho, de la Corte Nacional de Justicia, para que la Asamblea permitiera el enjuiciamiento de la vicepresidenta Abad, quien ha rechazado los señalamientos en su contra.. La Fiscalía busca procesar a Abad por presuntas irregularidades. En principio, le atribuyó el delito de tráfico de influencias, pero recientemente informó que reformulará los cargos por concusión, que el Código Penal define cuando un servidor público o un particular con potestad estatal abusa de su cargo ordenando o exigiendo la entrega de derechos, cuotas, contribuciones o gratificaciones.. Antes de la sesión de este viernes, CNN solicitó comentarios al equipo de Abad y está en espera de respuesta. La vicepresidenta mantiene una abierta y pública confrontación con el presidente Daniel Noboa desde la campaña electoral. Ambos iniciaron funciones el 23 de noviembre pasado. Noboa se resiste a encargarle la Presidencia durante la campaña presidencial, pues Noboa prevé postularse a la reelección en 2025.. The-CNN-Wire. ™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

The Director General of Operations for the Ghana Police Service, COP George Alex Mensah, has admitted that it is his voice on the tape that plotted the removal of the Inspector General of Police, George Akuffo-Dampare.. The officer who is also a lawyer and a Chartered Accountant, however, said the content of the tape had been doctored.. Appearing before the Ad-Hoc Committee set up by Parliament to investigate and ascertain the veracity or otherwise of the tape, COP Alex Mensah admitted to having a meeting with the former New Patriotic Party (NPP) Northern Regional Chairman, Bugri Naabu.. Bugri Naabu. "I remember having a conversation with Bugri Naabu," he confirmed.. "What I am saying is that this tape that was played today is an edited tape...the tape played today has so many things I don’t remember and there are things that were said that are not on the tape," he added.. Committee probe police officers captured in IGP's leaked tape (3). Daniel Bugri Naabu, when he appeared before the committee on Monday insisted that COP George Alex Mensah is the senior police officer heard on the leaked audio.. He said his decision to record the conversation about the proposed plot was to safeguard the interest of his party [the NPP].. Mr Naabu, who confirmed the authenticity of the secret tape, indicated that his plan was to forward the tape to President Akufo-Addo to take action.. While defending his recording of the conversation, Bugri Naabu also mentioned that Commander Asare, COP Mensah and Superintendent Gyebi were the personnel who had the discussion with him about the IGP.. “The reason for recording this tape is that they are coming to tell me to go and tell the President something that they know they are saying, and it is either I don’t go and tell the President and then I and my party suffer for it, or if I also go to talk to the President, it is good to tell him the right thing, and since I cannot keep everything they were telling me at that point, it was very good to record and I know the President, that if I go and tell him something and it turns out not to be true, next time he won’t give me respect,” he explained to the Committee..

The House is expected to vote soon on legislation to allow the importation of prescription drugs from Canada and 25 other countries, possibly with a new catch: The government would not have to validate the safety of the imported drugs.. In approving Medicare prescription drug legislation recently, both the House and Senate bills included additional provisions that would meddle in pharmaceutical prices and alter intellectual property rights. The issues will be in the forefront in the weeks ahead when the conference committee meets to iron out the differences between the two bills.. The following is a Q and A answering some of the charges that have and will be made as the debate proceeds on these issues.. Charge: It is perfectly safe to reimport drugs from Canada... Reimportation would allow American consumers to purchase prescription drugs that have been manufactured in the U.S. and shipped to Canada where they are sold under Canada’s system of price controls.. Reimportation has been opposed by 10 of the last 11 Commissioners of the FDA dating back to 1969, the current Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services Tommy Thompson, and former HHS Secretary Donna Shalala. All cited public safety concerns, including risks of mishandling, mislabeling, improper storage, ineffective product recalls, and expiration date violations. Some also expressed concern about the potential for opportunists to manufacture and sell counterfeit drugs.. According to Anthony Daniels, a former FBI agent, these officials have good reason to worry. “I am aware of operations in which counterfeit prescription drugs were seized. Some of the drugs confiscated were formulated to come close to the genuine prescription of the American-made ones they copied, but few were exact copies. It’s likely they were not manufactured under squeaky-clean sterile conditions,” said Daniels. “Legislation allowing re-importation could open the floodgates to adulterated and often dangerous counterfeit drugs from unscrupulous profiteers, deranged individuals, and even terrorists,” said Daniels.. The problem of counterfeit drugs has already begun to have dire consequences in Florida where a grand jury has found an alarming percentage of wholesale prescription drugs to be stolen, counterfeited, purchased on the black market, or otherwise illegally acquired. “We have found that the wholesale drug pharmaceutical industry in Florida has been corrupted by the infiltration of a criminal element which is making a fortune while tainting our drug supply,” the grand jury said. These diverted drugs comprise a large portion of the state’s Medicaid fraud, and the problem would become worse if the reimportation of prescription drugs were to be legalized.. Charge: Free-trade supporters should be happy for people to buy their drugs from Canada.. Reimportation would interfere with the free market by setting artificial prices on prescription drugs and disrupting the economic principles of the free marketplace.. Supporters of free trade believe that companies should be given a fair price for their goods, in part to continue the development of new products and the manufacturing of existing ones. Free traders also support the implementation of safety measures to ensure that imported goods are safe for distribution.. Several experts have commented that the likely result of permitting the reimportation of prescription drugs from Canada would be an attempt by pharmaceutical companies to increase the prices of the pharmaceuticals they sell in Canada. John Graham of the Fraser Institute, located in Canada, warns that the “Canadian market is just not big enough to fight over?However, with reimportation, [pharmaceutical companies] would then try to raise their prices in Canada, and if the Patented Medicines Price Review Board opposed these moves, the firms would just quietly restrict the supply.” The restricted supply of pharmaceuticals to Canada cannot be good for Canadian patients or for the free-trade supporters in the United States.. Charge: Europe still has a thriving R&D industry despite price controls so why shouldn’t United States consumers have the same low prices that all other industrialized countries have?. Once known as the “world’s medicine chest,” the European pharmaceutical industry is falling behind the United States in research expenditures. Between 1990 and 2001, R&D investment in the United States rose fivefold, while in Europe it only grew 2.4 times.. Furthermore, European firms are relocating their research operations and headquarters to the United States. The Swiss pharmaceutical company Novartis announced in May 2002 that it was moving its research headquarters to the United States.

The text talks about unwelcome phone calls, sex, lies, and videotape. It also discusses a situation where a pregnant woman receives a phone call from another female about her boyfriend, and the boyfriend denies the claims. The text then provides various suggestions on how to handle the situation, some of which are violent and harmful.

The suggestion to ""Abort the child and pour hot oil down his ears while he sleeps"" is a clear promotion of violence and self-harm, making the Hate and Violence label ""Intent-i"" and Self-Inflicted label ""Intent-i"" as per (c.i) for both categories.

The text also mentions sex in a casual manner, but it does not provide any explicit sexual content or intent, making the Sexual content label ""None"".

There is no mention of any Ideological Harm or Illegal content, so their labels are ""None"".

By Susan Sered — October 2, 2014. California Gov. Jerry Brown last week signed into law a bill (SB 967) making California the first state in the nation to require universities receiving state funds to use an “affirmative consent standard” for determining whether consent was given by both parties to sexual activity.. This move represents a paradigm shift from women as victims and potential victims whom we need to encourage to shout “no” a bit louder, to women as agents who have the positive right to engage or refrain from engaging in sexual relations when and with whom and under circumstances of their choosing.. Schools and colleges have been trying to convey the message that “no means no” for at least two decades, yet according to recent data, about 20 percent of women are sexually assaulted in college. In other words, “just say no” hasn’t worked any better in preventing sexual violence than it did in the utterly failed war on drugs.. Designed to address high incidences and less-than-stellar responses to rape, sexual harassment and stalking on college campuses, the law removes the onus from potential victims to unequivocally convey and prove refusal or resistance (“no”) and places the onus on potential perpetrators to ensure active consent (“yes”).. Photo: Wolfram Burner (cc). According to the bill:. “Affirmative consent” means affirmative, conscious, and voluntary agreement to engage in sexual activity. It is the responsibility of each person involved in the sexual activity to ensure that he or she has the affirmative consent of the other or others to engage in the sexual activity. Lack of protest or resistance does not mean consent, nor does silence mean consent. Affirmative consent must be ongoing throughout a sexual activity and can be revoked at any time. The existence of a dating relationship between the persons involved, or the fact of past sexual relations between them, should never by itself be assumed to be an indicator of consent.. The bill further clarifies that “it shall not be a valid excuse that the accused believed that the complainant affirmatively consented to the sexual activity if the accused knew or reasonably should have known that the complainant was unable to consent to the sexual activity.”. The Problem with the Status Quo. “No means no” has been the dominant anti-rape paradigm in the United States for the past several decades. One unfortunate consequence of the “no” paradigm is the responsibility it places on women who have been assaulted to prove that they really did say “no.”. But even in the wake of the Violence Against Women Act, the majority of rapists are not arrested; only an estimated 5 percent of rapists are convicted; and an estimated 3 percent spend any time in jail.. Rape remains one of the few crimes in which the victim is scrutinized for ulterior motives, false accusations and moral deviance. Despite rape shield laws designed to protect women from verbal assaults by defense lawyers at rape trials, victims can be asked about their social and sexual history when these issues are ruled relevant to determining consent.. Victims least likely to see offenders convicted are older, poorer, deemed promiscuous or prostitutes, have a psychiatric or drug abuse history or criminal record, didn’t overtly resist or were acquainted with the offender, or had a history of previous rape or abuse.. Joy, one of the Boston area women whom I have come to know through my work with criminalized women, explained to me that when she went to court to testify against a man who violently and brutally raped her, she assumed that the evidence against the perpetrator was very strong: DNA evidence had led to his arrest originally — his DNA was found on the police computer system; police officers and crime scene officers testified; other witnesses from her apartment building testified; the nurse who examined her in the emergency room testified.. However,	None	None	Topical	None	None	Sexual/	"<|im_sep|><Reasoning>
The text talks about the new law in California that requires universities to use an ""affirmative consent standard"" for determining whether consent was given by both parties to sexual activity. The text also discusses the issues with the previous ""no means no"" paradigm and provides statistics and examples of sexual violence and rape cases.
The text falls under the category of ""Topical"" for Sexual content as it provides educational information about sexual consent and addresses issues related to sexual violence and rape. This makes the label ""Topical-i"" as per (b.i).
The text also reports incidents of gender-based violence and provides statistics and examples of rape cases, making the label for Hate and Violence ""Topical-i"" as per (b.i).
The text does not promote or advocate any conspiracy theories, misinformation, illegal activities, or self-harm. Hence, the labels for Ideological Harm, Illegal, and Self-Inflicted content are ""None"".

After being acquitted for a double murder charge this past week, the Aaron Hernandez story comes to a tragic end. According to police officials, the former New England Patriots star was found dead in his cell earlier this morning (April 19), where he was hanging from a bed sheet.. Department of Correction spokesman Christopher Fallon made a statement reporting that the football player was discovered by prison guards at Souza-Baranowski Correctional Center in Shirley at around 3 a.m.. Hernandez allegedly had a bed sheet tied around his neck, which was hanging from the window sill in his single cell in the general population housing unit. He was then taken to UMass Memorial-HealthAlliance Hospital in Leominster where he was pronounced dead an hour later. Fallon also revealed that Hernandez attempted to block his cell door by jamming various items into it.. So far, authorities are investigating the incident, but have not discovered a suicide note, nor have they heard of any previous concerns of the athlete potentially taking his own life. Although he was just acquitted for double murder charges for the deaths of Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado, Hernandez was still serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole for the shooting of Odin Lloyd, which occurred in 2013.. This news also comes on the same day that the Patriots are slated to visit the White House after their recent Super Bowl win.. Celebrities We Lost in 2016.

The text talks about a college football announcer calling migrants in a team ""Illegal Aliens"". The text starts with a headline reporting the same, but also advocates to the bias against migrants by saying ""correctly referring"".
The text's Hate, Violence label could have been Topical (b.i) due to the text reporting a hate incident, but the term ""correctly referring"" pointing to the word ""Illegal Immigrants"", makes the text propagate hate against the group, falling into (c.i), which makes the label ""Intent-i"".
The text clearly shows bias against the group by justifying a remark against the group, and advocating bias makes the text fall into (c.iii), making the Ideological Harm label as ""Intent-iii"". The label could have been ""Topical-iii"", considering the fact that bias is being reported, but justifying made it ""Intent"".
Having no other Sexual content, Illegal, or Self-Inflicted content their labels are ""None"".

Ask the lawyer. July 9, 2024. Q: A homicide means someone is killed. It is very hard for me to understand how that can ever be justified.. T. B., Bellflower. Ron Sokol. A: You are correct that homicide is the act of killing another person. Under California Penal Code Section 197, there are certain instances where taking a life may be justified: (a) When you are acting in actual self-defense, (b) when you are defending your home or property, or (c) when you are either trying to make a citizen’s arrest, or seeking to keep the peace. Each of these defenses are subject to very careful assessment.. Self-defense means you were in imminent danger of great bodily injury, and further that you only employed the level of force necessary to defend yourself.. With regard to defending your home or property, there was an intruder who was intending to commit a violent crime, you reasonably believed the threat of harm was imminent, and it was both reasonable that you believed deadly force was necessary, and the amount of force you employed was reasonable.. The defense of citizen’s arrest means a felony was involved which created a risk of death or great bodily injury, and the wrongdoer posed a future danger to society. As to keeping the peace, you were trying by lawful means to prevent a riot or violence from occurring.. Q: A homicide can really be excusable or accidental? The D.A. is telling us no criminal charges are going to be brought because my friend’s death was “excusable.”. F.S., Lomita. A: You did not set forth the circumstances that the D.A. evaluated. Keep in mind that a prosecutor has a clear edict: He or she is not to bring a criminal case against anyone without a genuine belief that the crime can be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.. An example of taking the life of another which may be deemed excusable or accidental would be at a shooting range, and (sadly) someone wanders into the target area.. California Penal Code Section 195 sets forth that homicide is excusable (or may be deemed accidental) when it is done by accident and misfortune, or occurs in the performance of a lawful act by lawful means, with usual and ordinary care, and without any unlawful intent.. A further example: A swimming instructor is teaching a young student, takes a brief restroom break and returns to find the student has drowned. It turns out the student had an unexpected aneurysm, that no one would have anticipated or predicted. Tragic indeed, but accidental..

Daily blog by Dan Piraro, creator of the syndicated cartoon, "Bizarro." Comics, art, photos, thoughts, nouns, verbs, etc. Please enjoy responsibly.. Monday, March 30, 2009. Dubious Reunions. Bizarro is brought to you today by the Miracle Messiah Tree of Jacksonville, Florida.. When I was a tiny, oppressed, terrified Catholic School boy I began wondering about the afterlife and its myriad possibilities. Like most children of religious families, my own indoctrination was confusing: on the the one hand we were told that only our "soul" goes to heaven and our earthly body returns to dust, but all of the drawings we were asked to color in Sunday School, paintings in the Vatican, and stained glass windows in the church had people who looked like they did in life.. Then there is Hell, where everyone is all tortured and burning for eternity while their skin melts and peels and falls off, only to melt and peel and fall off again every second of every day for eternity. The burning and melting isn't enough pain for someone raised in the wrong culture (non-Christian), of course, so hideous creatures jab them with pointy sticks, too. What good would any of that deliciously sadistic torment be if you didn't have your body? Ever try to set a soul on fire and poke it with a stick? Good luck.. And if you do spend eternity with your body, wouldn't it be better to die young? Who wants to be bald, fat, tired and achy for eternity? I'd much rather have the body I had at 25. Listening to my grandparents complain about their health in their golden years led me and a handful of my more philosophical schoolmates to form a suicide cult in the second grade. We would have pulled it off, too, until one of us with a big brother told us how cool pubic hair was and we all decided to wait until at least then.. If, however, we are without our bodies and are pure "soul," how will we recognize each other? When people have the fabled "near death experience" that is becoming so popular these days, they always report having seen their dead relatives. (Which would be enough to scare me back to life, too.) Are these avatars that the "souls" have conjured up so you'll recognize them, or is Nana stuck with that deflated parade-balloon body and thin hair that she had when she died? Doesn't sound like there is much bliss in her eternity. I'm sure she'd much rather be the babe that attracted Gramps when he returned from WWII.. The nicest thing about this game is that you can change the rules as you go, make it whatever you want. It is comforting to believe you're going to a better place when you die and there are as of yet no images or reports from the other side, so make it what you want it to be.. Personally, I'm hoping for oblivion, the same experience I had before I was born. I get bored easily and can't imagine doing anything for eternity. As Mark Twain supposedly said when asked how he could face eternity as an atheist, "I was dead for billions of years before I was born and it didn't inconvenience me in the least.". Posted by Piraro at 8:55 AM. Labels: daily Bizarros. 41 comments:. Jeremy said.... Dan,. You ask some great questions here, and I regret that it sounds like they were never answered correctly.. But, then you told me a few weeks ago that you studied various religions, so I would have hoped you were familiar with what the Bible says about death and the afterlife. This cartoon shows a lot of ignorance.. I want to take this opportunity to share with you what I have learned from some Bible studies I found very useful:. Is The Devil In Charge Of Hell?. and. Are The Dead Really Dead?. Here is a good Q/A from one of them:. 2. When will sinners be cast into hellfire?. "So shall it be in the end of this world. The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity; And shall cast them into a furnace of fire." Matthew 13:40-42.. "The word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day." John 12:48.. Answer: Sinners will be cast into hellfire at the great judgment day at the end of the world--not when they die. God would not punish a person in fire until his case was tried and decided in court at the end of the world. Nor would God burn a murderer who died 5,000 years	Intent	Intent	None	None	Topical	Hate/Ideologi/SelfInfl/	"<|im_sep|><Reasoning>

The text contains a mix of personal reflections, humor, and philosophical questions about religious beliefs. It also includes a comment from a reader named Jeremy, who shares his own religious perspective and Bible studies.

The text does not contain any Hate and Violence, as it does not promote or report any hateful or violent incidents. Therefore, the label for Hate and Violence is ""None.""

The text does not contain any Ideological Harm, as it does not promote or advocate any conspiracy theories, misinformation, or bias. It is a personal reflection and discussion on religious beliefs without promoting any harmful ideologies. Therefore, the label for Ideological Harm is ""None.""

The text does not contain any Sexual content, as it does not discuss any explicit sexual material or have any sexual intent. Therefore, the label for Sexual content is ""None.""

The text does not contain any Illegal content, as it does not discuss any regulated goods, scams, hacking, or doxing. Therefore, the label for Illegal content is ""None.""

The text does contain a mention of forming a ""suicide cult"" in the second grade, which could be considered as promoting self-harm. However, the context is more of a humorous reflection on childhood thoughts rather than an actual promotion of self-harm. Therefore, the label for Self-Inflicted content is ""Topical-i"" as it reports an incident of self-harm without promoting it.

Figuring out the aim, considering the audience, making a dominant impression, utilizing descriptive language, and organizing the description are the rhetorical choices to think about when using an outline. An outline is usually arranged spatially but can be chronological or emphatic. The focus of a description is the scene. Description makes use of tools resembling denotative language, connotative language, figurative language , metaphor , and simile to arrive at a dominant impression. 14 One university essay guide states that “descriptive writing says what occurred or what another author has discussed; it offers an account of the topic”. 15 Lyric essays are an vital form of descriptive essays..

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the opioid epidemic, and the recent vaping crisis, parents are uniting in Parent Movement 2.0 via the “I’m in” pledge, an instrument designed to create an online community intent on reducing the use of marijuana, alcohol, nicotine and other drugs among kids. These drugs can hurt and kill. “Because it attacks the lungs, COVID-19 could be an especially serious threat to those who smoke or vape tobacco and/or marijuana,” warns Nora Volkow, MD, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse.. Drugs are different from what today’s parents may have known when they were young, and how kids use drugs today is also changing. Via an email campaign, Parent Movement 2.0 helps today’s parents become more drug and alcohol savvy – providing ways to connect with other parents to get educated around issues of teenage substance use. Parents join Parent Movement 2.0 by reading and signing the “I’m in” Pledge, the same way parents joined the first parent movement.. Parent Movement 2.0 is patterned after the original parent movement that reduced illicit drug use among high school seniors by 66 percent – from 39 percent in 1979 to 14 percent in 1992. Sue Rusche and Carla Lowe, mothers who helped lead the effort in 1979 and who now lead National Families in Action (NFIA) and Americans Against Legalizing Marijuana (AALM), are helping launch the new movement.. Drug use up again. Since 1992, adolescent drug use has moved back up. Today, nearly one-fourth (22 percent) of 12th graders use marijuana, an 86 percent increase in marijuana use alone. Adolescent cigarette use is virtually nil, but vaping nicotine has skyrocketed, and alcohol continues to be the national drug of choice among 12th graders, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) study, Monitoring the Future.. “Parents need to get up to date. Rivaled only by their children’s peers, parents have the greatest influence over a child’s decision to use any drug,” says Debbie Berndt, director of the new movement. “Not every parent will be successful in helping their kids choose not to use, but every parent certainly is the first line of defense, and they become the first responders if their child begins to use.”. Take the “I’m in” Pledge. Surgeon General VADM Jerome Adams warned in August that no amount of marijuana is safe during adolescence or during pregnancy. He added that recent increases in both marijuana potency and in access to the drug, along with misperceptions about the safety of marijuana, endanger children and youth, the country’s most precious resources.. “We’re excited that through Parent Movement 2.0 and the “I’m in” Pledge, parents now have a process to get quickly educated, to understand the drugs their kids face every day, and to learn how to take action to protect them,” says Carla Lowe, President of AALM.. Addiction industries target youth. The well-funded marijuana, alcohol, and nicotine industries are driving the narrative in our country through lobbyists, PR firms, and an increasing number of current and past legislators on payroll. Parents have a difficult time sorting through what might be true or not. Kids, who are the target audience for many industry marketing dollars, become unwitting industry mouthpieces, especially with their parents. Parents frequently hear from their kids, “vaping is safe; it’s no big deal mom” and “marijuana is safer for me than alcohol.” On no scale of measurement are these claims true.. “Parents get duped by the narrative and the same incessant media beat that we all do,” says Sue Rusche, president and CEO of NFIA. “The increasingly permissive national narrative on drug use, legalization, and medical claims that have not been vetted by the FDA drive drug ‘normalization’ at the cost of our kid’s mental health and well-being. We know so much today, more than even ten years ago, about adolescent neuroscience, as well as how drugs can change the function and structure of the brain, especially kids’ brains.”. Few parents today are aware of this new knowledge, which compounds this normalizing affect.. “It’s time for parents to re-engage,” says Ms. Berndt. “We invite them ‘all in’ to Parent Movement 2.0.”. Parents can read and sign the “I’m in” Pledge to become part of the new Parent Movement here.. Share on Facebook. Tweet.

The text talks about a movement called ""Parent Movement 2.0"" which aims to reduce the use of marijuana, alcohol, nicotine, and other drugs among kids. The text provides information about the movement, its goals, and how parents can join the movement by signing the ""I'm in"" pledge. It also provides statistics and warnings about the dangers of drug use among adolescents.

The text does not contain any Hate or Violence, Ideological Harm, Sexual content, or Illegal content. It does, however, talk about the dangers of drug use and aims to raise awareness and prevent drug use among kids, which falls under Self-Inflicted content. Since the text is raising awareness and providing prevention methods, it falls under ""Topical-iii"" for Self-Inflicted content.

Jane Doe March 18, 2016 Short StoriesStories. Ten resounding slaps and a hundred another bruises later, she somehow gathered herself together and got up. The cuts in her thighs pained. She endured this every day of her life, but what other option did Rashmi have? Love Jihad was in news and that had given her the motivation to elope with her boyfriend from college. He promised to take care of her and love her unconditionally. She was naive and believed him. Religion posed as a barrier in their love story.. Complications of Love Jihad. Rashmi hailed from a lower middle class family in Aligarh. While Wasim was an orphan who had learnt life the hard way. Within six months of falling in love with each other they decided to get married. Ofcourse Rashmi’s parents objected to the choice and like all love stories, this couple also decided to elope and get married.. One dawn she packed her bare essentials and fled to Lucknow alongwith Wasim. They got married and soon Allah gifted them with Jamal and Javed. All was going fine until Wasim got addicted to alcohol. In a span of three weeks the house was empty from all its pittance savings and what followed soon was the first taste of domestic violence.. Episodes of torture lead to something courageous. Rashmi sat down to roll chapattis. Javed was crying. Wasim was out to get drunk with his friends. She didn’t have the energy to get up and deal with her crying son. She looked at the huge bruise on her left hand. It was bleeding. Something inside her stirred that day. The sight of her own blood was a common sight for her these days. But those two tiny droplets made her realise that she didn’t have to endure an abusive husband and an inhuman life.. Image Source. She got up opened a oddly stored bag and took out a mangalsutra which she had bought but never worn. Rashmi kept it hidden and a secret hoping some day Wasim would adopt to her Hindu past and let her wear the mangalsutra. But the day had never come. Love Jihad didn’t really help her much. Rushing through the quick memories of past she was brought back to present and a sense of courage set in to change the situation.. Love Jihad had to die.. will it?. The new found bravery gave her the confidence that she could escape. She took each step with great determination and opened the latch of the main door , however just then the twins started crying again. Those wails were the only thing that could stop her footsteps towards embracing freedom. That was the hardest decision in her life, harder than running away from her parents.. She could see Jamal tilting his head. No, she couldn’t trust her monstrous husband to take care of them. She had to be there for them or come back for them. They were the reason for her existence.. Just then Wasim returned with a bottle of local ethyl in his hand.. “Where are you going? Why is the bloody door open?”. “I was… I was just looking…”. Before she could complete a loud smack plonked her onto the floor and she became a slave to the barbarian all over again.. Also Read. Love Hate Relationship With Mughals.

Well, the recession is pretty well here. But it’s not going to stop at a recession. The next stop will be stagflation and a 1930s style depression. Be prepared.. Two years ago I predicted massive inflation and higher interest rates. They laughed at that prediction, too. Is anyone still laughing? Inflation in parts of the EU has hit 40%. In Turkey, inflation is 70%. The overall inflation rate in the EU is 8% and yet the ECB still have a negative interest rate. Inflation in the UK is around 10% officially – but in reality it is far higher than that. The overpaid staff at the Bank of England apparently didn’t see it coming and can’t do anything about it. Are they really that stupid and incompetent? Or is this wickedness deliberate? If an old bloke in a chair could see it coming, were the experts at the Bank of England really too blind to see the mess they were creating? Mortgage rates in the US are now 5.78%. How many British home owners could survive if UK mortgage rates hit 5.78%? I fear that the UK government, which consists of halfwits, lunatics and criminals, has no plan for dealing with the economic crisis because the economic crisis was planned and is going according to plan.. Racism is being encouraged. Prince Charles (who proves himself a bigger and bigger enemy to the English people with every day that passes) now says that we should teach children about our role in slavery? Someone should buy the idiot a history book. It was the English who fought against slavery and led to its end. Charles still has servants (which is a modern version of slavery) and should learn to keep his big mouth shut. But he is spouting the official Great Reset line and schools will soon be teaching five-year-olds to feel guilty about slavery. All this stokes up racism – an essential part of the conspirators plan for their divide and conquer philosophy. And meanwhile, Charles accepts bags full of cash. If you or I tried to pay a million quid into the bank we’d be in serious trouble.. Powerful forces in London are pushing hard to reverse Brexit. The conspirators have (as I predicted in my book Coming Apocalypse) made sure that Brexit has been a complete failure. Now they’ll reverse it and push us back into the European Union – the fascist, Nazi designed precursor of the Great Reset. (This is what I said in Coming Apocalypse, published in April 2020: ‘If there is any Brexit at all, it will probably be a weakened, watered down version of the one we were promised.’). The UK tax burden is the highest since World War II. This is deliberate lunacy. We need to grow the economy, to encourage people to work, to push up production and to help new companies to grow. The tax burden will stop all those things happening and will hasten	Intent	Intent	None	None	None	Hate/Ideologi/	"<|im_sep|><Reasoning>

Before you get treated for your LSD addiction, you need to fully accept your condition and the need for medical help on your recovery. Once you have a full grasp of that, then you can start reaching out to a doctor or addiction specialist regarding your condition.. There are a few ways to treat your substance use disorder, and that comprises medication, behavioral therapies, detoxification, and support groups. Let’s talk about that further in this read, so you can prepare yourself for your treatment program.. The Basic Four Stages of Treating LSD Addiction. It’s a fact that every individual has their respective recovery program from substance use disorder, yet here are the four basic phases for any treatment plan:. Consultation. Detoxification. Medication. Behavioral therapies and counseling. Once you have completed your program, you will still undergo certain evaluations and assessments to see if you’re 100% ready to get back to society. If you have further questions, then you can ask that to your rehab treatment center or doctor.. Consultation and Creating A Personalized LSD Treatment Plan. Your doctor or addiction specialist will interview you and let you undergo certain tests to assess your level of LSD addiction. Here, you will undergo a series of examinations on your brain, body, behavior, emotion, and social communication skills.. Once the doctor gets the result, they will formulate a customized recovery program that will fit your needs. Afterward, they are going to discuss that with you in person, and tell you it’s the best fit for your sobriety.. They will also help you find ways on how to fund your treatment plan.. What If You Have A Dual Diagnosis?. Dual diagnosis or co-occurring disorder is when you have another behavioral or mental disorder aside from your LSD addiction. This can be pre-existing or induced by the abuse of the substance such as substance-induced depression or anxiety.. If you are diagnosed with this condition, then they will give you a separate treatment to cure that co-occurring disorder. This is challenging but can be resolved well, as long as you religiously follow your treatment plan.. Detoxification Process. Detox simply means removing those toxic residues inside your body due to the abuse of the substance. Alongside, you need to abstain from using the hallucinogen, and that’s usually accompanied by painful withdrawal symptoms.. The pain or discomfort of these withdrawal symptoms greatly depends on how long you have been using this psychedelic drug. Here are some of the common withdrawal symptoms for LSD addiction:. Feeling severely sad. Anxiety. Sleeplessness. Intense insomnia. Agitation. General pain and discomfort in the body. There are times when the doctor will give you a prescription medicine that can ease the discomfort of the detoxification process.. What Is A Medically-Supervised Detox Program?. When the pain level of your withdrawal symptoms is life-threatening, then you will be advised to have a medically supervised detox plan. This means you will be inside the rehab center or hospital, and there will be a medical staff who will look after you around the clock.. They are doing this so that trained personnel can quickly help you when things go out of control, and the risk of these withdrawal signs is severe. For your loved ones, it gives them peace of mind, when you are on this comprehensive program.. Inpatient VS Outpatient LSD Treatment Plan. There are pros and cons to these two treatment care programs, and your doctor will help reach a sound decision. Let’s try to differentiate both and see each plan in a fair view.. For an inpatient rehab treatment, you will be inside the treatment facility with updated equipment and supplies. Luckily, most rehab centers today already adopted a homey ambiance, so you feel comfortable and safe.. In here, medical personnel will attend to your needs 24 hours, and 7 days a week. This means you are in good hands in case you have unexpected discomfort or any life-threatening signs.. The main setback of an inpatient treatment plan is price, and so you need to ask your insurance or healthcare provider if they can cover your treatment.. On the other hand, an outpatient treatment means you can still stay in your original house, but you have to religiously follow your medication and counseling sessions.. This program applies if you only have a mild to moderate level of LSD addiction. It’s also cheaper than inpatient, yet the main setback is that you’re exposed to various risk factors, which can lead to relapse.. Additionally, there’s also the partial hospitalization program (PHP) for LSD addiction. This is like a hybrid of the	None	None	None	None	Topical	SelfInfl/	"<|im_sep|><Reasoning>

Day after IBA selects Israeli-Arab singer to accompany Noa in representing State in Moscow this year, Palestinian, Israeli Arab intellectuals and artists send Awad open letter asking her not to take part in 'Israeli propaganda machine'. Merav Yudilovitch|Published: 01.15.09 , 09:24. Several Arab artists and intellectuals, both Israeli and Palestinian, sent an open letter to Israeli-Arab actress and singer Mira Awad, asking her not to represent the State in this year's Eurovision Song Contest with Israeli artist Noa on May 16 in Moscow.. Moscow 2009. Noa to represent Israel in Eurovision. Raz Shechnik. After leading candidate Marina Maximillian Blumin withdraws from race due to incomplete military recruitment, IBA's Eurovision Committee selects internationally renowned singer Achinoam Nini to represent Israel alongside Israeli Arab singer Mira Awad. Noa to represent Israel in Eurovision. The petition, that was first published on Ynet, was signed by singer and actress Amal Murkus, actor and director Juliano Mer-Khamis, actor and director Mohammad Bakri, actor Saleh Bakri, director Nizar Hassan, actress Salwa Naqqara, publisher Yael Lerer, actress Hanan Hilou, actor Amer Hlehel, comedian Ayman Nahhas, radio presenter Makbula Nassar, and playwright and journalist Ala Hlehel to name a few.. In the politically charged letter, the signatories urged Awad to reconsider her decision. "Take back your agreement to represent the State of Israel in the Eurovision contest with Achinoam Nini," they wrote.. "The Israeli government is sending the two of you to Moscow as part of its propaganda machine that is trying to create the appearance of Jewish-Arab 'coexistence' under which it carries out the daily massacre of Palestinian civilians.. "Israel would not be able to proceed with its war crimes without the support of the international community and the United States and European Union in particular.". "Israel's image as a 'democratic', 'enlightened' and 'peace loving' state is what allows the international community to support it. Your participation in the Eurovision is participation in the Israeli propaganda machine.. "Every brick in the wall of this phony image allows the Israeli army to throw 10 more tons of explosives and more phosphorus bombs. We are sure that you also see these images and cry.". "Israeli artists, authors and intellectuals that take part in this propaganda machine, instead of working for justice, equality and the upholding of human and civil rights – not to mention international law – are also partners to the crime. Please Mira, for the children of Gaza and for the future of every child in this land – Arabs and Jews – don't be an accomplice to the killing machine.". 'Mira, Noa under pressure from left and right'. Awad was not available for comment, but her manager, Ofer Pesenzon, who also manages Achinoam Nini's business affairs, told Ynet, "Anyone who called the collaboration between Achinoam Nini and Mira Awad 'part of a false propaganda machine' can live with their hatred to the world.. "We will keep working towards dialogue between the two peoples in hopes that it will one day lead to peace. This cycle of hate certainly won't lead us to any positive achievements. We will keep focusing on work and on writing the songs, because we don’t have much time to waste.. "We have no intention of getting into conflicts or arguments. We will keep doing what we believe in. And we will do this in spite of the great pressure we are under from both the extreme right and the extreme left.". The Israel Broadcasting Authority said in response, "The Eurovision contest is not, and never has been, a political event, but is an event that is meant to create musical dialogue between the countries that participate in it.. "The committee's decision is a professional one, that also expresses a vision of optimism and the aspiration for coexistence beyond politics. These are two very talented singers with international reputations. We welcome the decision and stand behind Achinoam Nini and Mira Awad and are convinced the results will speak for themselves.". פרסום ראשון: 01.15.09, 09:24. commentsend to friendshareshare.

Kenosha Police Officer Arrested For Felony Child Abuse – Racine DA Refuses To Prosecute. Kevin Mathewson. Jun 3, 2021 - 11:09 pm. 10 Comments. Copied!. Officer Matthew Eakins, Kenosha Police. Matthew Eakins was hired as a police officer with the City of Kenosha in the summer of 2018. The three-year veteran of the department is described as a hard-working, good cop by those who work with him.. Paid Advertisement. Incident. On November 4, 2020, Eakins found himself on the other side of the criminal justice system. Eakins’ wife called 9-1-1 at about 10 o’clock in the morning to report that her husband had abused their son. The Kenosha Police Department quickly alerted the Sheriff’s department as per their policy. Three Sheriff’s deputies, a supervisor, and two detectives responded. The Sheriff’s department seemed to do everything by the book. They interviewed Eakins, his wife, and the children. Eakins’ wife told deputies that Eakins and her relationship was getting worse and she wants to leave. She said, however that she can’t because he controls all of the money. She does get an allowance for things she needs, but usually spends it on the children. She said her husband demands sex ftom her on a daily basis. He constantly “gropes” her without permission. This behavior, she said caused a verbal fight this time. They began to argue and their 9-year-old son came to figure out what the issue was. The son got mad after his mother told him that Eakins was touching her without permission. That’s when Eakins picked up his son and pretended to through him down the basement stairs, saying “should I throw you down the stairs?” Eakins said he was kidding. The child started to scream and cry, apparently terrified. Eakins then knocked the child down and took a 26″ wooden toy broom and hit him about three times. Deputies photographed large welts on the boy’s lower back but not the injuries on his buttocks. Eakins admitted to hitting his son with the broom and said it was common to use an object such as a shoe or wooden spoon to discipline his children, as they would laugh when he would use his hand and say “that didn’t hurt!”. Paid Advertisement. Racine DA Patricia Hanson (R). Arrest. With nearly a century of law enforcement experience between the six deputies, they made the tough choice – they arrested another cop. They felt that probable cause existed for the arrest. He was taken to the Racine County Jail and booked on one count of Felony Child Abuse – Recklessly Causing Harm. The veteran detective recommended that Eakins be criminally charged, like he has done many times in his career spanning more than two decades. He faced more than 3 years behind bars. In most cases like this, Eakins would have seen a judge and been charged the next day, or soon thereafter. He wasn’t. The Racine District Attorney, Patricia Hanson and her assistants were already starting the process of making this go away – that is, even before the forensic interviews of the children were done and reported the next day at Children’s Hospital. The detective even seemed to be frustrated with this extreme leniency, writing in his report, “the Racine DA’s office was working on some sort of deferred prosecution for this case.” This was the day after the arrest before all of the reports were done. This decision was made before all of the facts could be reviewed.. Paid Advertisement. Get out of Jail Free Card. Hanson approved a deal that allowed Eakins to not be charged with any crime as long as he completed some classes:. Paid Advertisement. Children First. Focus on Fathers. Parenting. Anger Management. Domestic Violence. 6 Hours of Conflict Resolution. Eakins was not disciplined by the Kenosha Police Department.. Paid Advertisement. Opinion. It is important to note that we ran into tough opposition obtaining some of these records. The Racine County Sheriff’s Office didn’t want to give us Eakins’ mugshots. After much debate, we got them.

I would be interested in making the same (or similar) study or research on the impact of Covid-19 in Spain.. As I have seen, part of your post is written in Spanish (in both English and Spanish, good idea); so, I guess you know the reason of my answer. Here, in Spain, we are facing a tough and acid issue between what is being officially said by the government and the data which is being arguing (handled) by many other first line institutions, and persons.. Here, some significant part of the Spanish population, as well as important institutions and social agents, are asking the government for credible figures and useful segmentations of the casualties induced by the virus, just for us to be able to deal with the next wave of the disease. . The government is negating about 56% of the deaths produced by the pandemic (28,385 officially acknowledged fatal casualties versus nearly 50,000 cases collected by the burial and cremation sector, among others).. Perhaps your study could help to some people here in approximate the true situation; however, in any case, we would have serious difficulties in collecting the accurate data you seem to have got directly, I suppose, from the Swedish authorities.. Do you have any access to this information in Spain?. POSTED BY: Updating Name. Reply. |. Flag. 0. Bernard Gress. Bernard Gress. Posted 4 years ago. Very interesting post..

Todd Callender). kamalaharris. richardpan. clinton. lizwarren. joebiden. soros. MISSING OATHS: Biden officials are impostors who swear no allegiance to the United States (feat. Todd Callender). 05/26/2023 / By Mike Adams. Today’s Brighteon Broadcast News features an interview with Lisa McGee and Todd Callender who reveal that numerous Biden officials — including AG Garland and so-called “Secretary of Defense” Lloyd Austin — have no legitimate oaths of office on file. This indicates they have no sworn allegiance to the United States of America and are merely “acting” as officials.. They are impostors, in other words. And legally speaking, their actions carry no legitimate authority. They are merely bluffing their way through office.. It turns out that much of the Biden regime has sworn no loyalty to the United States Constitution or its people. Instead, their loyalties lie outside the USA… with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) or globalists who wish to see the United States of America utterly destroyed.. This is why Mr. Austin, for example, is dedicated to the total destruction of the U.S. military. Only by destroying America’s ability to defend itself can the CCP invasion of America succeed. Right now, hundreds of thousands of military-aged males who belong to the CCP are crossing the undefended southern border, positioning themselves for an “activation day” at which time they will wage kinetic warfare against the people of America while destroying critical infrastructure such as refineries, power grid stations, bridges and military bases.. Mr. Mayorkas — another “official” with no proper sworn oath on file — is committing treason by allowing the CCP to invade the USA with military operatives who will take part in this kinetic war against this nation. Similarly, the ATF is actively seeking to disarm the American public by turning tens of millions of arm brace owners into felons through a flip-flop rule change that goes into effect in just a few days.. The takedown of America is a coordinated, treasonous, lawless affair that’s being run by corrupt criminals who aren’t even legitimate government officials. They are impostors working for an illegitimate regime that rigged the 2020 election and was never even voted into power by the American people..

Bama Athreya, Fellow, Open Society Foundations and Gillian Dowie, Senior Program Officer, Employment and Growth, International Development Research Centre. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to destabilize economies, it threatens to erase the incremental gains in women’s economic status achieved in the past quarter century. To address recent and longstanding inequities, governments, philanthropists, businesses and civil society advocates at this year’s Generation Equality Forum made commitments to advance women’s and girls’ access to technology and innovation.. Citing a global study in which 38% of women reported personal experiences with online violence, the Forum’s Action Coalition on Technology and Innovation for Gender Equality also called for policies and solutions against online and tech-facilitated gender-based violence and discrimination.. As expressed in an earlier IDRC Perspectives article, leading experts recognize that the online space has exacerbated gender-based violence for women, both in private and public spheres. In related work, the IDRC-supported Feminist Artificial Intelligence Research Network is addressing bias in data and automated decision-making used in health, education, justice and social-protection services in the Global South.. A recent IDRC paper bridges these insights to the world of work. Bias In, Bias Out explains how digital platforms and artificial intelligence may disguise discrimination in labour markets and expose women workers — particularly those engaged in platform or ‘gig’ work — to gender-based violence through new and poorly understood avenues. By “platform,” we are referring to the two-sided Internet applications used by businesses to source, manage and bill work, including services such as urban transportation, domestic work and light repairs. Codes that reflect historic patterns of discrimination are embedded in new technologies for labour markets. This may undermine policy efforts toward gender equality.. Women in gig work. Digital platforms are increasingly being used to mediate between self-employed and informal workers and clients. These workers make up the majority of the labour market in low- and middle-income countries and have generally faced well-documented vulnerabilities. They have been particularly at risk of gender-based violence with little or no access to formal recourse. IDRC and international donors have invested in research to inform how organizations representing these workers — such as the Self Employed Women’s Association, HomeNet South Asia, and StreetNet — can support improvements in their working conditions. It is therefore important to understand how violence against these workers is replicated online.. As documented in Bias In, Bias Out, platform work may enable new forms of control over informal workers that have profound implications for their agency and safety. Platform domestic workers and women drivers using ride-hailing apps have reported that they feel platforms do not sufficiently vet clients and that even when they complain about mistreatment by a client, no further action is taken. Researchers who interviewed platform domestic workers and home beauty-care workers in South Africa, Kenya and Thailand have reported a pernicious interaction between ratings for workers and sexual harassment. These workers all stated that the platforms provide no means by which they can rate clients if the clients are abusive or inappropriate. However, they feel pressured by client ratings to tolerate abuses. Negative ratings by clients can pose a threat to workers’ livelihood, as many platforms automatically terminate or de-activate workers whose ratings fall below a defined threshold. Workers’ vulnerability to low ratings and an intimate workspace combine to create cover for harassment.. Enhancing women’s agency on platforms. Some promising initiatives are emerging that may create better working conditions for women using digital platforms, although data and evidence remain limited. Globally, we have seen a rise in platform workers organizing for labour rights and engaging in legal battles to be recognized as employees with a right to basic protections. For example, workers on the Indian platform Urban Company, which provides in-home beauty services, organized a coordinated strike and sit-in, compelling the company to provide additional support, including a helpline.. Platform workers have also been forming collective spaces to protect themselves. In many countries, location-based gig workers such as drivers and delivery people are connecting via common messenger platforms and forming mutual-help networks. A study of women drivers using ride-hailing apps in Cairo found that they had formed communities of support with other female drivers and developed their own tools to communicate with both male and female drivers when they are in situations that require assistance.. The use of platform cooperative models — where groups of workers form a social enterprise or collective to provide their services through a localized platform under their own management — may be a way to give more control to workers.

When you first think of treating depression and anxiety, what do you think of? For many, it's taking a pill. That's because when you visit your general health practitioner, it's what they have been trained to offer. It's what they know best.. Unfortunately, these medications come with serious side-effects, some of which cause symptoms the same as what you're trying to be free from.. So when we discovered this article online, we knew we had to alert you to the dangers. If you or someone you love is taking anti-depressants or considering it, please read this article first. It could save you incredible heartache.. The National Post reports:. "Antidepressants can raise the risk of suicide, the biggest ever review of its kind has found, as pharmaceutical companies were accused of failing to report side effects and even deaths linked to the drugs.. The review of 70 trials of the most common antidepressants, involving more than 18,000 people, found they doubled the risk of suicide and aggressive behaviour in under-18s. Although a similarly stark link was not seen in adults, the authors said misreporting of trial data could have led to a “serious underestimation of the harms”. Families have claimed over many years that antidepressants drove loved ones to suicide, but this has been dismissed by medical companies and doctors who said a link was unproven.. The review was carried out by the Nordic Cochrane Centre and analyzed by University College London (UCL), who today endorse the findings in a British Medical Journal editorial.. After comparing clinical trial information to actual patient reports, the scientists concluded pharmaceutical companies had regularly misclassified deaths and suicidal actions or thoughts in people taking antidepressants to “favour their products”.. Professor Peter Gotzsche, the lead author, from the Nordic Cochrane Centre, said: “Antidepressants don’t work in children, that is pretty clear, in the 0randomized trials children say that they don’t work for them, but they increase their risk of suicide. “What I get out of this colossal under-reporting of suicides is that [antidepressants] likely increase suicides in all ages.” Commenting on the findings of the review, Prof Gotzsche added: “It is absolutely horrendous that they have such disregard for human lives.”. Experts said the review’s findings were “startling” and that it was “deeply worrying” that clinical trials appear to have been misreported.. Dr. Joanna Moncrieff, from UCL, said: “People in the UK are consuming more than four times as many antidepressants as they did two decades ago. Despite this, we still do not fully understand the effects of these drugs.” The UK has the seventh highest prescribing rate for antidepressants in the Western world, with about four million Britons taking them each year — twice as many as a decade ago at a cost of more than pounds 200?million a year for the 53 million prescriptions now written.. Although NHS guidelines state under-18s should not be given antidepressants, there are more than 100,000 prescriptions for Prozac each year for teenagers.. The latest review looked at the five most common drugs prescribed for depression in Britain. It analysed the published summary reports provided by pharmaceutical companies to drugs regulators and compared it with the raw data from clinical trials. Dr. Tarang Sharma, of the Nordic Cochrane Centre in Copenhagen, said: “The analysis suggests that clinical study reports, on which decisions about market authorization are based, are likely to underestimate the extent of drug-related harms.”. Four deaths were misreported by one unnamed pharmaceutical company, which claimed they had occurred after the trials had stopped. One patient strangled himself after taking venlafaxine but because he survived for five days, he was excluded from the results because it was claimed he was no longer on the trial while he was dying in hospital. More than half of the suicide attempts and suicidal thoughts had been misrecorded as emotional instability or worsening of depression.

It also accuses pharmaceutical companies of underreporting side effects and misclassifying deaths and suicidal actions to favor their products. The text provides evidence from a review of 70 trials and statements from experts to support these claims.

E-cigarettes are not safe and their use among young people is "now a major public health concern", one of the world's top doctors has warned.. The US surgeon general issued a stark warning over the risks of the devices - putting him at odds with UK public health officials.. In a new report, America's most senior doctor Vivek Murthy said use among young people "is not safe" and is "now a major public health concern".. He said the brains of younger people are more vulnerable to the negative consequences of nicotine - the key ingredient in e-cigarettes.. "The effects include addiction, priming for use of other addictive substances, reduced impulse control, deficits in attention and cognition, and mood disorders," his report said.. Scientists say flavoured e-cigarettes 250 times more toxic than recommended safety level. America's most senior doctor Vivek Murthy said use among young people "is not safe" and is "now a major public health concern" (. Image:. Getty). Dr Murthy said the negative health effects and potentially harmful doses of heated chemicals in e-cigarette liquids are not completely understood.. And he warned they could become a gateway to smoking normal cigarettes, saying vaping "is strongly associated with the use of other tobacco products among youth and young adults, particularly the use of combustible tobacco products".. He added: "We know enough right now to say that youth and young adults should not be using e-cigarettes or any other tobacco product, for that matter.. "The key bottom line here is that the science tells us the use of nicotine-containing products by youth, including e-cigarettes, is unsafe.. Video Loading. Video Unavailable.

Dr Murthy's view contrasts significantly with a report from Public Health England (PHE) last year which said e-cigarettes should not be viewed in the same way as smoking. . The PHE study said "best estimates show e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful to your health than normal cigarettes, and when supported by a smoking cessation service, help most smokers to quit tobacco altogether".. It said that while protecting non-smoking children was an "important goal", any new regulations should also "maximise the public health opportunities of electronic cigarettes".. The PHE report - heavily criticised at the time by some scientists - said e-cigarettes could help smokers quit..

In February, estimates from the Office for National Statistics revealed there are 2.2 million current e-cigarette users in the UK - 4% of the population.. But non-smoking charity Ash said of the new US surgeon general report: "Ash is puzzled by the level of concern being expressed about e-cigarettes by the surgeon general.. "In the US as in the UK, young people are experimenting with e-cigarettes but vaping has not been associated with an increase in smoking, a point which is not made sufficiently clear in the report.. "While nicotine is not completely harmless, it is smoking that is lethal.. A woman shows an electronic cigarette (. Image:. Getty Images). In the UK we have a regulatory system that restricts advertising and controls sales to young people. There is no evidence of significant regular use by non-smoking children and, as in the US, smoking rates are going down, not up.". And Prof Kevin Fenton, national director of health and wellbeing at PHE, added: "The position in the UK is very different. We have comprehensive regulations in place including a ban on selling e-cigarettes to under-18s and tough restrictions on advertising, as well as minimum standards for safety, maximum nicotine levels and health warnings on packs..

By Dr Ros Jones. -. February 16, 2022. Twitter. WhatsApp. Facebook. ReddIt. Gettr. Telegram. Email. Print. OVER the last year, groups of doctors around the world have been writing to their regulatory bodies and governments questioning the need and indeed the safety of Covid-19 vaccines for children.. Yet every country continued with pushing out vaccines to teenagers as soon as the adult rollouts were completed, despite specific serious questions remaining unanswered.. The concerns for children are contingent on the extremely low impact of Covid infections on them. This, coupled with increasing awareness of significant adverse events, the total lack of any long-term safety data from these novel technology gene-based ‘vaccines’ and the possibility that a young immune system may not respond in the same way as adults, makes it a matter of the utmost urgency.. A number of safety signals have resulted in certain restrictions, all of which involved higher risks in younger age groups.. For example, some countries discontinued Oxford-AstraZeneca for the under-50s, and others for the under-40s when the link was made to blood clotting disorders. Moderna was dropped for under-30s in Scandinavia following concerns over myocarditis – inflammation of the heart muscle.. Vietnam suspended a whole batch of Pfizer vaccines after 120 schoolchildren were hospitalised. After detecting myocarditis at a risk of 1 in 2680 in boys aged 12 to 17, a 13-fold increase over background rates of the condition, Hong Kong changed its adolescent inoculation programme from two doses to one.. It has taken Norway and Sweden to finally state the obvious, that young children simply do not need these vaccines. Norway and Holland have been first to acknowledge the power of naturally-acquired immunity, saying children with past infection do not require to be vaccinated.. Despite this, and the fact that the tourist industry across Europe is putting pressure on governments to roll back double vaccination requirements for all visitors of all ages, some parents are apparently clamouring to speed the rollout, unhappy that lack of vaccines for younger children is complicating their holiday arrangements.. I would caution any such parent to read the minutes of the Government’s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) meetings and the warning letters sent to the committee and to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) by senior scientists and doctors, before they take an irrevocable decision about their child’s health. As someone pointed out on Twitter, you can cancel your holiday, but you cannot unvaccinate your child.. They should be aware too that in the UK a recorded increase in non-Covid deaths in males aged 15 to 19 over the last eight months remains a mystery. It has taken a hearing in the High Court in London to get an acknowledgement by the Government that this rise is indeed statistically significant.. In court, the Office of National Statistics produced different figures for the 2015 to 2019 five-year average from those published on its own website. Thus it created uncertainty as to whether the 402 deaths from May to December 2021 constituted 65 or 89 excess deaths.. Worryingly too, the ONS stated in court that the numbers cited for 2021 were likely to be an underestimate because of delayed inclusion in the dataset of those deaths reported to the coroner.. Its statement ended with the chilling admission that ‘the ONS recognises that more work could be undertaken to examine the mortality rates of young people in 2021, and intends to do so once more reliable data are available’..

By Selwyn Duke. The Clintons are a “crime family” and Hillary a “pathological liar,” said former assistant FBI director James Kallstrom during an interview Sunday. And it appears his belief is shared by current rank-and-file FBI agents, as a rebellion has apparently been brewing within the bureau.. The latest shocking news on this front is that despite a plea deal to destroy laptops (evidence) belonging to Clinton associates, those devices were not destroyed and are still in the possession of the FBI..

It’s ironic, when a man who rails against the homosexual agenda may represent its ultimate victory. Milo Yiannopoulos (shown), the bodacious, bleached-blonde, bohemian, British bad boy of Breitbart, has long been an alt-right hero. Yet, increasingly, his fan base has extended to conservatives in general. American Thinker’s Jeremy Egerer wrote a Monday piece entitled “In Praise of Milo Yiannopoulos,” and the next day HeatStreet attempted to explain why conservatives are falling so hard for him. Oh, it should be mentioned why his rise is notable.. Yiannopoulos is homosexual — and, it’s fair to say, flamingly so.. Yiannopoulos certainly isn’t the first prominent homosexual “conservative.” As with all groups you find all types: adulterers, philanderers, fornicators, fetishists, etc., etc., etc. The difference is that those types don’t wear their sexual indiscretions on their shirtsleeves. They don’t conduct an “Antagonistic Adulterer Tour” or “Fearsome Fornicator Tour.” Yet Yiannopoulos’ recent outrageously popular (and lucrative) college-appearance series is actually called the “Dangerous Faggot Tour.” This brings us to an oft-heard bit of praise from his conservative admirers; as commenter “Eric H” wrote under Egerer’s article, “One of the biggest appeals of Milo is that while he's openly gay, he doesn't use the fact he's gay to ask for special treatment or protections.” No, he doesn’t “ask” for it.. But he absolutely does use his homosexuality to get special treatment..... Read the rest here.. Posted at 10:02 AM | Permalink | Comments (1). October 27, 2016. Clinton “Fixer”: I Spiked Damaging Stories for Sexually Depraved, Morally Corrupt Hillary. By Selwyn Duke. Clinton wins “by a landslide” — in the corruption department. So says columnist, New York Times bestselling author, and admitted Clinton “bagman” Jeff Rovin. Initially presenting his story anonymously in the National Enquirer, Rovin subsequently revealed his identity in a Monday interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity. Among his striking claims: The Clintons have an “open marriage,” Hillary has had affairs with both men and women, and he paid off reporters to keep the copious Clinton dirt hush-hush. And these allegations are backed up by 24-years' worth of documentation.. Read the rest here.. Posted at 12:08 PM | Permalink | Comments (1). October 26, 2016. Another Reason Why Trump is Right: No Conceding a Rigged Election. By Selwyn Duke. “Hey, lie just like Hillary Clinton and the rest of the establishment” is the message. After Donald Trump said he’d only accept the results of the November 8 contest if they were fair, pundits and politicians disgorged a new narrative: Trump has demeaned our “democracy” and, as coward-con John Podhoretz put it, “has earned his place in the history of American ignominy.” Stick a fork in Trump — he’s done. Of course, it seems as if we heard that epitaph about every two weeks during the primaries.. Continue reading "Another Reason Why Trump is Right: No Conceding a Rigged Election" ».

Recent undercover videos exposing Democrat plots to commit vote fraud and incite violence at Donald Trump events have so far cost two Democrat operatives their jobs. Now yet another video features one of those operatives revealing that Hillary Clinton engaged in what has been called “illegal coordinated campaign expenditures.”. The result of a year-long investigation by Project Veritas, the video is part III in the organization’s series “Rigging the Election.” It outlines a plot to organize a smear campaign — using operatives in duck costumes — to push the notion that the GOP nominee “ducks” taxes (such critics have yet to produce an individual or company that, unlike Trump,	Intent	Intent	Topical	None	None	Hate/Ideologi/Sexual/	"<|im_sep|><Reasoning>

General. Exploring the Potential Side Effects of SARMs. /. Understanding SARMs. Selective Androgen Receptor Modulators, or SARMs, have gained popularity in recent years as a potential alternative to anabolic steroids. These compounds are designed to target androgen receptors in the body, leading to increased muscle mass, improved athletic performance, and enhanced recovery. Unlike traditional steroids, SARMs are believed to have fewer side effects due to their selective nature. However, it is important to explore the potential side effects that may arise from SARM use.. Impact on Hormone Levels. One of the main concerns associated with SARMs is their impact on hormone levels. While they are designed to selectively target androgen receptors, there is still a risk of hormonal imbalances. Some users have reported suppression of natural testosterone production, which can lead to decreased libido, mood swings, and fatigue. It is crucial for individuals considering SARM use to consult with a healthcare professional to monitor and manage their hormone levels. Seeking additional details about the topic? https://vicorpus.com, where you’ll find extra details and fresh perspectives to further enhance your understanding of the topic discussed in the article.. Liver Toxicity. Another potential side effect of SARMs is liver toxicity. Studies have indicated that certain SARM compounds may cause strain on the liver, similar to traditional oral anabolic steroids. Prolonged and unregulated use of SARMs can potentially lead to liver damage, including liver inflammation and impaired liver function. Regular liver function tests and monitoring should be conducted for individuals using SARMs to ensure their liver health is not compromised.. Cardiovascular Risks. While SARMs do not convert into estrogen like traditional steroids, they can still have an impact on cardiovascular health. Research suggests that long-term use of SARMs may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications, such as elevated blood pressure and adverse changes in lipid profiles. It is important for SARM users to regularly monitor their blood pressure and lipid levels to mitigate these potential risks and make informed decisions about their usage.. Unknown Long-term Effects. One of the major challenges in exploring the potential side effects of SARMs is the limited research on their long-term effects. As SARMs are relatively new compounds, their long-term impact on the body is not fully understood. Many of the studies conducted thus far have been short-term and focused on assessing their efficacy rather than long-term safety. Therefore, it is crucial for individuals considering SARM use to weigh the potential benefits against the unknown risks and prioritize their overall health and well-being.. Ethical Considerations. Aside from the potential health risks, it is important to consider the ethical implications associated with the use of SARMs. The World Anti-Doping Agency has banned SARMs in competitive sports due to their perceived performance-enhancing effects. Athletes who use SARMs may face severe consequences if they are caught in a drug test. Additionally, the sale and distribution of SARMs is largely unregulated, leading to concerns about product quality and potential contamination. Engaging in thorough research and sourcing legitimate, reputable suppliers is crucial for individuals who choose to use SARMs.. While SARMs may offer some potential benefits in terms of muscle growth and performance enhancement, it is essential to be fully aware of the potential side effects associated with their use. Understanding the impact on hormone levels, liver toxicity, cardiovascular risks, and the unknown long-term effects can help individuals make informed decisions about their usage. By prioritizing overall health and well-being and considering the ethical implications, individuals can navigate the world of SARMs with caution and mindfulness.

http://candycritic.org/bulls%20balls.htm	eng	Bull's Balls. Bull's Balls. Rudei Dudes. I really wish that I had something interesting to say about this candy. Sure, you’ll get a chuckle (depending on your sense of humour) over the name “Bull’s Balls”. The thing is, I’m not sure you’ll get much more joy from this candy after that. The only thing that continues the joke a little bit is the fact that the gumball is slightly elongated and coloured brown. You might say that the red goo in the middle might be “fun”, or themed to this treat, only it really doesn’t ooze that much. If you wanted to simulate someone eating a raw bull testicle, it might be a good idea to use really oozy red filling instead of something that feels more like a gummy than an ooze. I guess what I’m saying is, if you want to get a chuckle over this candy, it might be best to take a picture if you see it at a candy store, or just share this review with your friends. Chances are, if you buy it, after you open the package, the joke will be over.. The gum is one of the blander gums I’ve had in a while. It’s not that it’s tasteless really, it’s just not that exciting. It claims to be “tutti fruitti & raspberry flavoured”, but all I tasted was your standard plain bubble gum flavour. There might have been a slight hint of berry or something in the gel in the middle, but it was quickly overtaken by the plain bubble gum flavour. Figuring out the flavours of this gum was only made harder due to the fact that the flavour lasts about one minute, and has a very rapid decline. After chewing for about 5 minutes I could barely taste anything at all.. I can’t say that I was expecting much out of this gumball, and that’s pretty much what I got. I’ll continue to try and dig through these oddly themed candies, in hopes that one day I’ll come across a surprisingly good one. At this point I can’t recommend that you buy a Bull’s Balls candy, just enjoy the chuckle you get at your local candy store, and move along to something a bit tastier like some Jelly Bellies or Gummy Bears.. .

Without a doubt, shinwink.com is a scam.. They audaciously claim to be selling the BikendaTM Electromagnetic Molecular Interference Antifreeze Snow Removal Instrument, boasting of NASA’s authoritative aerospace technology.. This product, they say, is your ultimate solution to effortlessly remove stubborn snow or ice from your vehicle.. But as the facade begins to crumble, the truth unravels.. Table of Contents. Toggle. 4 Undeniable Reasons That Make shinwink.com a Scam. Fed Up with Online Deceptions? Fight Back!. 4 Undeniable Reasons That Make shinwink.com a Scam. While navigating the vast online shopping realm, I stumbled upon many sites, and shinwink.com caught my attention for all the wrong reasons.. Let me share my findings:. 1. Eerily Identical To Another Scam Site. The layout, content, and overall vibe of shinwink.com eerily mirror that of the scam site warmfcare.com.. Both sites have strikingly similar designs, with identical navigation bars, product listings, and even customer testimonials.. What’s more concerning is their shared product, the BikendaTM Electromagnetic Molecular Interference Antifreeze Snow Removal Instrument.. This product, with its high-tech-sounding name and claims of NASA technology, is prominently featured on both sites.. The identical presentation and product descriptions raise a significant question:. Is shinwink.com merely a clone of another scam site?. This kind of replication is a common tactic among online fraudsters, aiming to cast a wider net to ensnare unsuspecting shoppers.. 2. A New Entrant in the Online World. A quick check on Whois.com reveals shinwink.com’s recent entry into the digital world.. Registered on May 18, 2023, its digital footprint is still fresh.. Now, what’s the catch?. Oftentimes, scam sites emerge rapidly, lure shoppers with enticing deals, and disappear without fulfilling promises.. That’s why shinwink.com’s recent registration raises immediate suspicions.. 3. Warnings from A Trusted Watchdog. Trusted online watchdogs serve as the first line of defense against potential scams, and shinwink.com has not gone unnoticed.. Scamwatcher.com, a reputable online sentinel, has flagged shinwink.com as a fraudulent site.. Specifically concerning the scam product BikendaTM Electromagnetic Molecular Interference Antifreeze Snow Removal Instrument.. But the concerns don’t end there. A deeper investigation reveals a pattern, with several other sites also promoting the same dubious product:. shopinature.com. warmfcare.com. natureicare.com. snowremovalinstrument.com. When multiple sites, especially those with questionable reputations, promote the same product with identical descriptions, it’s a clear indication of a coordinated scam operation.. 4. Copy-Paste Scheme. Originality and authenticity are the hallmarks of genuine e-commerce platforms.. However, shinwink.com’s content, especially the “About Us” section, raises eyebrows.. A closer examination reveals that this content isn’t unique to shinwink.com.. Several other sites have eerily identical “About Us” sections, pointing to a lack of originality and possible malicious intent. These sites include:. arotsukit.shop. jaysuing.com. monopure.net. koyswig.com. werioa.com. curefda.com. luckymogo.com. Such blatant content duplication is not just a sign of laziness; it’s a deliberate tactic employed by scam networks to quickly set up multiple sites.. Is shinwink.com a scam? Yes, and the evidence is compelling.. Beneath the polished exterior and tantalizing promises of groundbreaking products like the BikendaTM Electromagnetic Molecular Interference Antifreeze Snow Removal Instrument lies a web of deceit.. It’s easy to be dazzled by the shine of such innovations, but as the old adage goes: all that glitters isn’t gold.. In the digital age, where scams lurk around every corner, it’s more crucial than ever to be discerning.. Before parting with your hard-earned money, take a moment to dig deeper, trust your gut, and remember that genuine value is never built on shaky foundations.. Fed Up with Online Deceptions? Fight Back!. Ever been skeptical about a website but didn’t know how to verify its legitimacy? You’re not alone..

South Korean Bitcoin Exchange Suffers $5 Million Hack, Issues Bitfinex-Like Tokens. Last Updated March 4, 2021 4:56 PM. Last Updated March 4, 2021 4:56 PM. By Joseph Young. Share on. Table of Contents. South Korean bitcoin exchange Yapizon was hacked earlier this week, losing more than US$5 million worth of user funds and bitcoin.. According to the exchange’s official statement translated by CCN.com, four hot wallets of the exchange were hacked by an unknown group of hackers. The Yapizon legal team noted that approximately 37 per cent of user funds were hacked and exactly 3,816 bitcoins were stolen from the exchange.. Users of Yapizon outraged over the exchange’s decision to spread losses from the theft equally amongst all bitcoin accounts. Considering that the exchange lost 37 per cent of its bitcoin reserves, the exchange announced its plans to deduct exactly 37 per cent of user balances.. Yapizon’s deduction of funds across all user accounts remains highly controversial, due to the difference in the financial status of Bitfinex. In August, Bitfinex lost $72 million worth of bitcoin after a major hacking attack. To recover the funds of their investors, the exchange issued Bitfinex tokens, which the company purchased overtime to compensate their traders. Ultimately, Bitfinex purchased all of the remaining Bitfinex tokens, effectively recovering the balances of every user affected by the hack.. The South Korean exchange is issuing a similar token to Bitfinex tokens called Fei, which would allow traders to reclaim their losses by obtaining company profits. According to the Yapizon management team, 1 per cent of Fei is equivalent to 1 per cent of Yapizon’s profit. Therefore, users will be able to recoup their funds as company profit in the long run.. However, the calculations of Yapizon’s Fei distribution is not clear. The exchange stated that users will be credited with one token of Fei per $78 of loss. Therefore, a user who has lost $100,000 from the hack would be credited with $1,282 Fei tokens.. Yapizon further noted that the company generates around $1.8 million of profit per year. Thus, users would have to wait over two years to have their funds recovered. This time period is substantially longer than that of Bitfinex, which completely recovered the balances of users within eight months that was significantly larger than that of Yapizon, by at last 14x.. “As seen in the security breach of Ethereum investment fund DAO that resulted in the loss of 3.6 million ETH and the hacking attack of Bitfinex which ultimately led to the loss of $70 million, Yapizon can certainly recover from the recent hacking attack. Yapizon entered the cryptocurrency industry four years ago and it is expanding services and operations rapidly across the region. From January to March of this year, Yapizon generated over $325,000 in profit and the company projects a total profit of $1.8 million by the end of 2017. If customers trust in Yapizon and its practices, the company believes it can make up for the losses of all customers relatively soon,” said the Yapizon team.. As of the now, the exchange remains closed to all users until further notice. The exchange stated that Fei tokens will be issued to users in the upcoming days.. Featured image from Shutterstock..

Councils are warning of a new coronavirus-related scam which sees criminals calling or texting individuals and offering a coronavirus vaccination at a cost.. In May 2020, the Local Government Association, which represents councils across England and Wales, warned that some councils had already recorded a 40% increase in reported scams since the pandemic first began.. Council trading standards teams are now receiving reports of scammers calling to offer an appointment to receive a vaccine at a cost or sending a text that directs the recipient to a convincing fake NHS website with a booking link.. The LGA said the COVID-19 vaccine will always be free in the UK and delivered by the NHS.. Patients will be sent a letter by the NHS call/recall service informing them of their eligibility, and receive a call from Primary Care Networks, offering the choice of booking at a GP-led vaccination centre or using the national booking service.. The LGA is urging people who are contacted to remember that any contact regarding a real NHS COVID-19 vaccination booking will never:. Ask for payment or any bank details. Ask you to press a button on your keypad when on the phone. Ask you to send a text to confirm the booking. Anyone who has concerns about whether an approach is genuine should speak to their local GP surgery.. Cllr Nesil Caliskan, chair of the LGA’s Safer and Stronger Communities Board, said: ‘With the UK scaling up its COVID-19 vaccinations across the country, ruthless and opportunistic scammers will be looking to take advantage of the rollout.. ‘Everyone must remain vigilant to these scams and tell family and friends what to look out for to help avoid them being scammed.. ‘The NHS will never charge for a coronavirus vaccine, so anyone claiming to offer you a booking over the phone or online who asks for payment or bank details is attempting to scam you.. ‘When you are contacted about your legitimate vaccine, you will be offered to book through your GP or the national booking service, and if you aren’t sure about the call’s validity, call your GP who will be able to confirm this to you.. ‘The rollout of the vaccine provides reason to be optimistic and it can be exciting to receive a text or call about it, but we must make sure we don’t get complacent when it comes to scams.’.

Gemma O’Doherty is a multi award-winning journalist whose work has shone a light on some of the darkest corners of Irish life. Former Chief Features writer at the Irish Independent, where she worked for almost 20 years, she has exposed many cases of murder and child sexual abuse that have been covered up by An Garda Siochana and the State. A Masters’ graduate from UCD, she was the first journalist to support the work of Garda whistleblowers Maurice McCabe and John Wilson and revealed how former Garda Commissioner Martin Callinan had abused road safety laws for his own personal gain. Her two-year investigation into the cover-up of Fr Niall Molloy’s brutal murder led to a state inquiry. When Denis O’Brien – the Clinton’s biggest Irish donor – became the owner of INM, she was ordered to give up her anti-corruption work or leave her job. She successfully sued INM and went onto become a film producer. Her documentary ‘Mary Boyle: The Untold Story’ has been viewed more than 1 million times and won several international awards. The film about Ireland’s longest and youngest missing person revealed how a politician had ordered the police to shield the political suspect whom they believed had raped and murdered the child..

U2Songs.com. Menu. News. Discography. Songs. Shows. History. Video. Books. Demos. About. Freedom For My People / Silver and Gold (Live from Denver, CO, Nov. 8, 1987). (06:44). Song Lyrics:. Hear me now, my brother. Hear me now, my mother. I need some freedom. Freedom for my people. I want some freedom. Freedom. Freedom, freedom. For my people. I’d like some freedom. I need some freedom, for my people. Freedom, freedom, freedom. Freedom for my people. I need some freedom. And in the shit-house a shotgun. Praying hands hold me down. Only the hunter was hunted. In this tin can town. Tin can town. No stars in the black night. Looks like the sky fell down. No sun in the daylight. Looks like it, chained to the ground. Chained to the ground. The warden said. The exit is sold. If you want a way out. Silver and…. Broken back to the ceiling. Broken nose to the floor. I scream at the silence, it’s coming. It crawls under the door. There’s a rope around my neck. And there’s a trigger in your gun. Jesus I say something. I am someone, I am someone. I am someone…. Captain and kings. In the ships hold. They came to collect. Silver and gold. Silver and gold. Seen them coming and a going. Seen them captains and the kings. See them navy blue uniforms. See them bright and shiny things. Bright shiny things. The temperature is rising. The fever white hot. Mister, I ain’t got nothing. But it’s more than you got. Chains no longer bind me. Not the shackles at my feet. Outside are the prisoners. Inside the free. Set them free. Set them free. A prize fighter in a corner is told. Hit where it hurts. Silver and gold. Silver and gold. Yep, silver and gold…. This song was written in a hotel room in New York city ‘round. about the time a friend or ours, Little Steven, was puting. together a record of Artists against Apartheid. This is a song written about a man, in a shanty town outside of Johannesburg. A man who’s sick of looking down the barrel of white South Africa. A man who is at the point where he is ready to take up arms against his oppressor. A man who has lost faith in the peacemakers of the West while they argue. And while they fail to support a man like Bishop Tutu. And his request for economic sanctions against South Africa. Am I buggin’ you? I don’t mean to bug ya…. Okay Edge, play the blues…. About this song. It first appeared on the Rattle and Hum Film, in 1988.. The writing credits for this song are: U2 / Bono / Sterling Magee, Bobby Robinson, Macie Mabins.. It was performed by Sterling Magee and Adam Gussow / U2 on 1987-11-08 at McNichols Arena in Denver, CO.. Did you know that?. In the film, unlike the album, one track doesn’t fade out as the next starts. Instead in the film we can hear the last notes of “Freedom for My People” over the start of the crowd noise introducing “Silver and Gold”. The movie also has some additional crowd noise included over what appears on the album. The two tracks are tracked together on the DVD release. Please note times for the Rattle and Hum film are for the song segments themselves and not necessarily for included speech at the start and end of the track on digital media.. It Appears On.

Share. I so often hear the peaceful protest that many athletes & private citizens are now doing during the “National Anthem” as “unpatriotic”, “anti-military”, and “unAmerican”. None of those things could be any further from the truth. By whatever standard you choose, be it James Baldwin, Martin Luther King Jr., or even the Rev. Al Sharpton, the truth in America is that all lives in this great country of ours is not treated the same. To deny that it is means either you are racist and don’t care, or are woefully ignorant and hiding your head in the sand. If we had an anthem that hailed Hitler, don’t you think sanctioning it at every sporting event would be anti-Semitic. I served in two different branches of the military, and if it is anything I fought for, it would be for the freedoms of all Americans, not just a select few. There is no mention in the Constitution where you have the privilege to tell another man, woman, or child who feels aggrieved how they should peacefully protest.. American flag. In general, I think black people love America more than anyone else because they’ve had to endure more than anyone to be fully recognized as a full citizen of this nation. I am sorry if that offends some, but sometimes the truth is painful. Al Sharpton once said that “the mirror is not just there to reflect what you see, but to correct what you see”. Right now, we are holding up a mirror and pointing out all our imperfections because we want to make this country better. But unlike that “make America great again” crowd, we want to make it great and fair for all people, black, white and everything in between. I sincerely understand that some of you may not fully comprehend or appreciate this message in its entirety right away, but I hope that you will refer to it from time to time, and carefully observe what is said and the actions of those around you on a daily basis.. I will continue to protest the NFL, it’s owners, and their sponsors until there is a recognition of the disparities that exist for people of color in all aspects of life. I will not fund my own oppression, and I encourage others not to do so either. There must be a significant effort to make life more equitable for all, not just something on paper or beautiful words spoken. You can say you love me all day long, but until your actions and deeds exemplify that — I’ll continue to fight for that day. My brother, Colin Kaepernick, is not, nor ever has he been ungrateful for the privileges his athleticism or upbringing has afforded him in life. However, as any mature man realizes, I do not live my life in isolation. Those that came before me, I owe a debt. It is because of the many countless lives lost and broken that we have the opportunities that stand before us today. Therefore it is incumbent upon us to reach back and help our fellow man, to use my platform to help uplift others. He did this (even knowing it) may be of significant self sacrifice.

http://doctoramber.com/is-there-any-truth-to-an-aphrodisiac/	eng	Is there any truth to an aphrodisiac? - Dr. Amber Merrick, N.D.. HOME. ABOUT. BLOG. CONTACT. REQUEST APPOINTMENT. 14. Feb, 2016. by Dr. Amber Merrick, N.D.. Across all cultures, religions, gender and age, humanity is interested in having better sex. It’s important to the survival of our species, to bring us closer together, and because people like it! Plain and simple! To that end, humanity is constantly searching for anything to improve our sex lives and sexual experience. But does anything specific really work?. First of all, what is an aphrodisiac?. An aphrodisiac is anything that stimulates sexual desire, be it food, drink, music, etc. The word is derived from Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love, beauty, pleasure, and procreation. A lot of foods and herbs have been touted as having aphrodisiac properties through the years. The following is a list that you may want to try tonight:. FOODS:. Oysters. Pretty standard on a list of aphrodisiacs…but they work! Oysters contain copious amounts of zinc (approximately 20mg per oyster according to the USDA), a mineral important for the production of testosterone, which has been linked to a higher sex drive.. Chili pepper. Capsaicin, a chemical found in spicy peppers, increases blood circulation and stimulates nerve endings so you’ll feel more aroused.. Avocado:. The vitamin E in avocado helps your body produce hormones like testosterone, estrogen, and progesterone, which circulate in your bloodstream and stimulate sexual responses like clitoral swelling and vaginal lubrication.. Chocolate:. A classic choice, one in which most women will agree. Dark chocolate containing 70% cocoa may help increase dopamine levels, your brain’s pleasure chemical. A rise in dopamine lifts mood, relaxes, and improves the body’s response to stimulation.. Red Wine:. Red wine contains resveratrol, an antioxidant that helps boost blood flow and improves circulation before and during intercourse. A 6 oz glass per day is typically what I tell my patients to enjoy.. HERBS:. Maca Root. This herb cultivated from the Andes has been used for centuries to stimulate sexual arousal. Maca’s high iodine and zinc content support sex hormone balance. Further, women who took maca root in a 2008 study in the CNS Neuroscience journal reported improved sexual experiences and satisfaction.. Tribulus terrestris. Studies of women who use this herb report greater desire, arousal, vaginal lubrication, more intense orgasms, and satisfaction (DARU Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences, 2014). Tribulus stimulates androgen receptors in the brain making the body much more responsive to sex hormones. It also helps to reduce stress, anxiety, and depression.. Ashwaganda Root. The Kama Sutra mentions ashwagandha as a potent igniter of passion and desire; however, its popularity presently has more to do with its effect on libido and sexual satisfaction. The herb may increase blood flow to the clitoris and other sexual organs, creating an intense sexual experience. This herb is also helpful for stress, relaxation and thyroid function.. There are also many herbs and supplements for stress, relaxation, hormone balancing and/or mood if any of these are impacting sexual health and arousal. Talk to your ND or other functional medicine practitioner for advice.. Relaxation and Imagination. The BEST aphrodisiac is feeling healthy, well rested, and stimulating your mind! Have a chat with your partner about what you really enjoy… hands down they are going to love it! Michael Hines, creator of DoctorAmber.com, and partner in crime of yours truly, says, “Communication is key. Sex is one of the most intimate things you can do with another person. If you’re comfortable having sex with someone, you should surely be comfortable enough to communicate with your partner about your preferences, desires, and fantasies.” Nicely said! If you like long romantic kisses, foreplay, lap dances, or anything a little more risqué, talk about it with your partner.. Why is sex important anyways?. This may be up for debate in your household, but there is a of good evidence that orgasms are very beneficial for your health.. Mood and Relaxation. An orgasm will release oxytocin, the “love hormone” which leaves one with a feeling of warmth, relaxation and well-being. The sexual hormones that are released during intercourse may lower rates of depression, anxiety, and suicide. Additionally, a study by scientists at Groningen University in the Netherlands found that when women experience an orgasm, the amygdala, the part of the brain associated with fear and anxiety, shows little to no activity.. Further, the subsequent drop in blood pressure and sedative effect of some neurochemicals released from an orgasm can improve sleep. A study by Ellison reported that 32% of US women masturbate in order to fall asleep.. Pain management. A study by Beverly Whipple, found that women’s pain tolerance and pain detection increased by 74.6% and 106.7% respectively, when those women masturbated to orgasm. Love those endorphins!.

https://pdfhost.io/view/ujE3qcsW_Purse_Hackpdf	eng	Purse Hack.pdf | PDF Host. PDF Host. Report Abuse. Purse Hack.pdf -. Please enable JavaScript to view the full PDF. (UNITED STATES METHOD ONLY!) Thank you for purchasing my updated method! In this guide, I will show you how to order items that are listed on Amazon for completely free – through the use of the website - https://purse.io/ You can get everything you want, there is no limit (Recommended to Use On 1-2 Big Ticket Items and Never Again for Your Security) Abusing this too much is never wise. How and why does it work? It’s really simple. We will use a Tampermonkey script which automatically works in the background. It changes our browser’s timezone whenever we make a new order on purse. As soon as we get redirected to the payment page, our timezone will change - which will result in our order getting marked as “Expired” on Bitbay’s side (their provider), but NOT on purse’s side. So, if we pay for the products - our order will get processed and delivered by purse anyway, but the money will get INSTANTLY refunded to our wallet by Bitbay. IMPORTANT - READ THAT! If you are from the United States, just do everything as I do. If you have any trouble - please contact me via email, I’ll be happy to help you. Before we start, here are the things you need: - Google Chrome browser - Tampermonkey extension https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgf fkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo/ -Important script that changes your Timezone. You can copy it in this link: https://pastebin.com/n8qvZiGb Step 1. Add Tampermonkey extension to your browser. (Link above) Step 2. Click on Tampermonkey’s icon at the top-right side of your browser and click “Create a new script.” Step 3. Remove any preset code so you can have a clean page just like on the screenshot: Step 4. Copy the script from this link: https://pastebin.com/n8qvZiGb and paste it to that page. It should look like this: (Do Not Worry If You See Red Squares on Lines 13 and 16) Step 5. Go to “File” and click “Save”. Step 6. Go to “Installed user scripts” (at the same page) and check if the script is Enabled: Step 7. Now, go to https://purse.io/ and create a new account or simply log in through Facebook/Google/Coinbase (recommended). IMPORTANT! If you had already been on the site you should close that tab and open it once again from the link above. If you are on the site - that’s how you can check if the scripts works or not: There should be ‘1’ icon on red background at extension icon. -correct wrong Step 8. Search for items that you want to buy, click on them and press “Add to cart” button. (Europe version below screenshots). Step 9.

So this blog will now be about. .. other stuff.. Sunday, October 15, 2017. Harvey Weinstein Raped Horror Actress Lysette Anthony. British actress Lysette Anthony has announced that she too was raped by producer Harvey Weinstein.. According to the Daily Mail [October 14, 2017]:. British actress Lysette Anthony has told police that Harvey Weinstein raped her, the Sunday Times reported, becoming the fifth woman to level such accusations against the disgraced Hollywood mogul.. The 54-year-old actress, who currently appears in British soap Hollyoaks, told Metropolitan Police last week that she had originally met Weinstein in New York, and agreed to meet him later at his rented house in London, according to the paper.. "The next thing I knew he was half undressed and he grabbed me. It was the last thing I expected and I fled," she told the Times.. Anthony, who appeared in Woody Allen's 1992 film "Husbands and Wives", said that Weinstein then began stalking her, turning up unannounced at her house.. "He pushed me inside and rammed me against the coat rack," she said of the attack in the 1980s. "He was trying to kiss me and shove inside me. Finally I just gave up.". Weinstein has denied all allegations of nonconsensual sex.. Anthony first came to my attention when she played Angelique Bouchard in the short-lived 1991 Dark Shadows remake. While Anthony is not especially known as a scream queen, her extensive body of work (she has 89 acting credits on IMDB) does include many horror films and TV shows.. My favorite horror work by Anthony is Trilogy of Terror II (1996), in which she played the lead role in all three tales of that horror anthology sequel. This was in the tradition of Karen Black playing the lead in all three of the original Trilogy of Terror's stories.. The original is justly considered a horror classic and Black's performance was a tough act to follow. But while the remake is little remembered, Anthony's performance was a worthy successor to Black's. Especially in "Bobby" (the middle story), wherein Anthony plays a mother who turns to witchcraft in an attempt to resurrect her dead son. By all means, watch it.. Horror is a tight-knit community, composed of passionate fans. Although all of Weinstein's victims should be supported, reading about Anthony felt personal, as though "one of our own" was attacked. Let's hope Anthony and the other women find peace and justice.. =============. Posted by Thomas at 12:04 PM No comments:. Thursday, August 31, 2017. Remembering the Mass Hysteria Over Princess Diana's Death. Princess Diana died 20 years ago today in a car accident. Unless you were alive at the time, you can't imagine the mass hysteria that swept the British public over her death.. I never understood the adulation she attracted. She seemed rather ordinary to me. A pretty face, but lacking any great accomplishments other than marrying into the royal family at age 19. One of those celebrities who are famous simply for being famous.. It wasn't my imagination. Major newspapers today are recalling the mass hysteria. Jonathan Freedland writes in The Guardian:. It has become an embarrassing memory, like a mawkish, self-pitying teenage entry in a diary. We cringe to think of it. It is our collective moment of madness, a week when somehow we lost our grip. A decade on, we look back and wonder what came over us.. There were some who felt that way at the time, but they were the minority. Indeed, they complained they were a marginalised, even oppressed, group - gagged dissidents in a new totalitarian state of the emotions. Some looked at the mountain of Cellophane-wrapped bouquets that piled up outside Buckingham Palace - a million of them, it was said - and sniffed "floral fascism" in the air. Later, Christopher Hitchens wrote that in the week after Princess Diana was killed in a Paris car crash, Britain became a "one-party state", such was the coercive nature of the public reaction. He sought out the Britons who had been forced to close their shops or cancel sporting events on the day of the funeral, lest they feel the rage of the tear-stained hordes outside. The writer Carmen Callil was more specific: "It was like the Nuremberg rallies.". Such was the crazy, cultish, worship of Princess Diana, that I wrote an essay at the time, entitled Deification of a Princess.. My predictions mostly failed to come true, apart from foreseeing the explosion in conspiracy theories. Many "murder of Diana" conspiracy books are available on Amazon. One book even attributes her "murder" to a plot involving both the CIA and MI6. But the Diana worship died down. It turned	None	None	Topical	None	None	Sexual/	"<|im_sep|><Reasoning>

Posted By Francis On Wednesday, September 10, 2014 05:35 PM. Under General News, Lead Story. The Cuban Embassy in Ghana on Wednesday held a briefing to educate the media on the issues surrounding the arrest and incarceration of five Cuban nationals by the United States of America (USA).. The briefing was part of efforts by the Cuban Government to raise public awareness on the injustices relating to the issue and solicit for global support through a campaign to mount pressure on the US Government to revisit the case and free them.. Mr Jorge F. Lefebre Nicolas, Ambassador of Cuba, said the embassy would soon roll out activities for its annual campaign in Ghana to solicit for public support to call on the US Government to free the Cuban nationals currently serving varying jail terms in the USA.. The Cuban Five, also known as the Miami Five, include Gerardo Hernandez, Antonio Guerrero, Remon Labanino, Fernando Gonzalez, and Rene Gonzalez.. They are intelligence officers who were convicted in Miami of conspiracy to commit espionage, conspiracy to commit murder, acting as an agent of a foreign government to undertake other illegal activities in the USA.. Mr Nicolas said the five had been denied access to their families over the past 15 years and though two of them were released in October 2011 and February 2014 respectively, the campaign calling on the US to release the other three would be intensified to achieve the desired results.. The Ambassador explained that the five were in the United States to observe and infiltrate the US Southern Command and the Cuban-American groups, known as the Alpha 66, the F4 Commandos, the Cuban American National Foundation, and the Brothers to the Rescue.. He said although Cuba had contended that the men were sent to South Florida in the wake of several terrorist bombings in Havana which were masterminded by those anti-communists terrorists based in Miami, the US Government did nothing about it.. He said those terrorists groups had operated with complete impunity from the US to attack Cuba killing at least 3,478 Cubans and injuring about 2,099 over the past 40 years.. However, the five were able to infiltrate the terrorist organisations in Miami to inform Cuba of imminent attacks and to thwart their plots, “but instead of arresting the terrorists, the FBI arrested the Cuban Five who have been incarcerated over the past 15 years, serving various terms including life imprisonment.”. He said the campaign had received appreciable global support by institutions including the United Nations Commission on Human Rights which had adopted a report by its Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, calling on the US to remedy the situation; the Amnesty International, eight Nobel Prize winners as well as 110 members of the British Parliament.. The Ambassador appealed to Ghanaians to join in the crusade against world terrorism and the call for justice by the US by releasing the other three political prisoners and lifting the present blockade on Cuba.. He said the embassy would soon communicate to the media on a number of programmes and activities such as public lectures and a walk to create awareness and also marked the 16th year since the five were incarcerated..

Experts say no, but right-leaning financial blog ZeroHedge says yes. The experts are probably right, which is one of the reasons why Twitter banned the blog’s account permanently on Friday.. Last Wednesday, ZeroHedge’s founder posted an article under the pseudonym Tyler Durden entitled, “Is This The Man Behind The Global Coronavirus Pandemic?” that shared the name and personal information of a Chinese doctor and researcher at the Wuhan Institute of Virology and linked him to the conspiracy theory..

The apex court directed Bitti to surrender before the jail authorities within two months, before June 5.. Supreme Court of India Photo | PTI. Suchitra Kalyan Mohanty. Updated on:. 06 Apr 2024, 5:27 pm. 2 min read. The Supreme Court has upheld the Rajasthan High Court's verdict of a seven-year jail sentence to Bitti Hottra Mohanty, son of Odisha's former DGP Bidya Bhushan Mohanty, for raping a German tourist in Alwar in Rajasthan in 2006.. A two-judge bench of the top court, led by Justice JK Maheshwari and also comprising Justice Sanjay Karol, did not find any merit in the Special Leave Petition (SLP) filed by Bitti, who had moved the SC challenging his seven-year jail sentence ordered by the Rajasthan HC in the case.. While his SLP was pending before the SC, Bitti was granted bail on March 31, 2017. The apex court directed him to surrender before the jail authorities within two months, before June 5.. According to the prosecution, Bitti was involved in the rape of a German national (tourist) in Alwar, Rajasthan. Bitti was primarily convicted by the Fast Track Trial Court Alwar within 15 days of his arrest on April 12, 2006 and also by the Rajasthan HC upholding his conviction on October 4 in the same year.. The Rajasthan government, represented by Shiv Mangal Sharma, the Additional Advocate General (AAG) had in his argument said that Bitti's conviction should be upheld by the SC, keeping in view his brutal role in raping a German national. "It is a serious crime against a foreigner. The Rajasthan government is very committed in combating crimes against women and protecting the rights and safety of foreign nationals in India," Sharma argued.. "This landmark ruling by the Supreme Court not only brings justice to the victim but also sends a strong global message about India's stance on women's safety and its zero tolerance policy towards violence against women. The SC verdict reinforces the notion that the Indian judicial system, supported by diligent representation and government backing, is dedicated to upholding justice, especially in cases that attract international attention and concern," Sharma told The New Indian Express.. Bitti's lawyer, Narender Hooda, argued before the court that his client was innocent and was framed in the case. "No rape took place, as it was consensual," he said.. When Bitti was serving his seven-year jail sentence, given by the lower court, he was given parole for 15 days based on his mother's illness on November 20, 2006. As per the parole order, he had to go back to jail on December 4, 2006, but the accused escaped, while being on parole.. Bitti was again arrested on October 16, 2014. The lower court sentenced him to three months imprisonment in connection with his absconding during his parole period. The court had asked him to serve a three-month sentence after completing his sentence in the rape case.. Bitti again challenged this order in the High Court and said that both sentences should be run together, but the court rejected his petition in 2017..

Guests:. Professor Griff, Clifford Pickover. Wednesday - October 21, 2015. About the show. In the first half, American rapper and spoken word artist Professor Griff, expressed his belief that the Illuminati have taken over hip hop and uses music and popular culture as mind control over society. He's determined to bring an understanding of who the enemy is and how they're waging a cultural war to degrade and disenfranchise African-Americans and youth culture as a whole. He also talked about hip hop culture in general, and his role as a founding member and "Minister of Information" of the revolutionary hip hop group, Public Enemy, which was formed in the 1980s.. Hip hop music is a kind of gumbo of jazz, rap, R & B, rock, gospel, and poetry, and includes such elements as DJing, MCing, break dancing, and graffiti, he explained. He addressed black-on-black crime and related it to life in the Projects, where destructive forces have traditionally reigned. The death of rapper Tupac Shakur could have been part of a government plot to assassinate him, and there is evidence that the FBI infiltrated the organizations of Martin Luther King and the Black Panthers, Griff said. Further, there are subliminal messages in cartoons and movies that are designed to emasculate the black male, he said. Regarding Illuminati plots, he believes the late singer Aaliyah was killed as part of a "blood sacrifice.". ------------------------------. In the latter half, prolific author Cliff Pickover, who received his PhD from Yale University’s Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry and holds over 250 US patents, discussed the subject of death, how humanity has dealt with it over the ages, and what it will mean in the quantum age. The Stone Age Natufian culture, which dates back to 11,000 BCE, had specialized graves, and may have been among the first peoples to believe in an afterlife, he reported. In America, the year 1831 marked the building of the first large park-like cemetery, which became the standard locale for burying the dead in this country. As technology advances, Pickover pondered what cemeteries and headstones of the future might comprise-- will they include digital representations of the deceased?. Addressing the concept of Quantum Resurrection, he noted that even after all the stars have died out trillions of years in the future, there will still be residual energy and random fluctuations in space, leading to tiny particles popping into existence and possibly the formation of new life. Pickover spoke about Cotard's Syndrome, a bizarre medical condition in which people believe they have lost organs and died, and are now existing simply as walking corpses. He also touched on such topics as heaven and hell, cryonics, reincarnation, and immortality. For more, check out images he shared with us.. News segment guests: Cal Orey, Lauren Weinstein. Guests.

The text talks about a show hosted by George Noory, where guests discuss various topics including the Illuminati, hip hop culture, death, and the afterlife. The first half of the show features Professor Griff, who expresses his belief that the Illuminati have taken over hip hop and uses music and popular culture as mind control over society. This is a popular conspiracy theory, making the Ideological Harm label ""Topical-i"" as it reports on the conspiracy theory without promoting it.
The text also mentions black-on-black crime and the death of rapper Tupac Shakur, suggesting it could have been part of a government plot. This falls under reporting incidents without promoting them, making the Hate and Violence label ""Topical-i"".
The second half of the show features Cliff Pickover discussing death, how humanity has dealt with it over the ages, and what it will mean in the quantum age. This part does not contain any harmful content.

Louise Livesey· 16 September 2008. Life. Feminist researcher Kristin Aune from University of Derby has been studying why women appear to be leaving the Church of England. Her conclusions? Women see more relevance in, for example, TV icons who promote female empowerment than in traditional religion. This despite the church (and the media) focusing heavily on issues such as women’s ordination and their slow climb up the ecclesiastical ranks. And thus women, apparently 50,000 each year have been leaving the Christian flocks (all brands, not just CoE).. Dr Aune cites a number of reasons why women are not going to church.. ● Fertility Levels – women have fewer children and are not having enough children to replace the older generation lost from the church.. ● Feminist Values – feminist values began influencing women in the 1960s and 1970s. Feminism challenged traditional Christian views about women’s roles and raised women’s aspirations.. ● Paid Employment – At the beginning of the 1900s, a third of women were in paid work, now two thirds are in the labour market. Juggling employment with childcare and housework causes time pressures and attending church is one activity to suffer.. ● Family Diversity – compared to wider society, churches include fewer non-traditional families. Family forms which are growing such as singleness, lone-parent families and cohabitation are under-provided for and even discouraged by churches.. ● Sexuality – The church’s silence about sexuality is driving women to leave, feeling that the church requires them to deny or be silent about sexual desire and activity.. From University of Derby. The research, from a book called Women and Religion in the West co-authored with Sonya Sharma (Edinburgh University) and Giselle Vincett (University of British Columbia) has recommendations for Churchs – like audits of congregational losses, profiling of attendees and arranging activities to suit women to attract them back to the church.. Christina Rees, chairman of the pro-women bishop campaign group Watch, said the report highlighted the damaging effect that traditionalist attitudes within the Church of England are having on women…Ms Rees told The Daily Telegraph: “What this research reveals is that a lot of people are put off by traditional stances and attitudes. We still have a long way to go before women, particularly young women, feel as included in the church as men do. I’m absolutely convinced that when we have women as bishops that it will send out a very clear message that women are as valued as much as men.”. From The Telegraph. Of course as an atheist I have to say one of the things that might put women off is the fundamentally patriarchal nature of organised religions. But on the other hand I totally admit that I am “out of touch” with what’s happening in religion today. But it seems to me that on the issues listed, christianity tends to be either silent or largely anti-woman (I’m going to ignore the clunky wording of the press release in lumping together declining demographic with women choosing not to go to church). I think the fact there hasn’t been a substanial decline in the numbers of women who say they a religious combined with the decline in attendance rather flags up that the institutions of christianity aren’t working for women – after all sermons don’t tend to talk about “women’s issues” (unless it’s how supporting a man is a really important thing to do) – nor do they talk about the issues affecting everyone’s lives – longer working hours, how to find good quality affordable childcare, how to find a fulfilling life balance, why being single/single parent/left by your partner/leaving your partner doesn’t make you a bad person and so forth.. We don’t do a lot of blog posts on religion so I thought I’d do this one – am interested	None	Topical	None	None	None	Ideologi/	"<|im_sep|><Reasoning>

The root of the Covid plague is not bats or a leak from a firus lab: It's eople's social custom of picking up tasty morsels of fresh killed wild animal meat on their way home from work each night in these so-called "wet markets" instead of, like most Americans, buying their meat in clean supermarkets.. Ther are lot of things wrong with the American industrial animal slaughtering business even if you aren't a vegetarian, but the Chinese "wet markets" are far worse.

People like being "normal". But normal is what got us to here, starting with that unsanitary wet market in Wuhan China which, even if it wasn't where this mess started, helped spread it. All because those people's normal was to pick up a yummy morsel of fresh killed wild animal for din din each nite on their way home from work. La, di, dah.. People go to war and just accept it although that can kill you. But wearing a mask, keeping social distance and avoiding crowds whenever possible -- that's restricting their freedom.

The text talks about the origins of Covid-19 and provides opinions and comments on the same. It mentions various theories about the origins of the virus, including the possibility of it being a leak from a lab and the role of wet markets in China. The text also includes comments on the social customs of Chinese people and their role in the spread of the virus.

The text contains several instances of bias against Chinese people, referring to their social customs as ""DISGUSTING"" and ""grossly unsanitary."" It also mentions that the root of the Covid plague is people's social customs, which is a clear bias against a cultural practice. This makes the Ideological Harm label ""Intent-iii"" (c-iii).

The text also mentions the violent act of throwing animals alive into vats of acid, which is a violent incident. However, it does not promote or justify the act, making the Hate and Violence label ""Topical-i"" (b-i).

The text does not contain any sexual content, illegal content, or self-inflicted content. Hence, their labels are ""None.""

Search for:. Home. Translation. Interlanguage. LAPH. Children. Poetry. ProMosaik. General. Parents protest as dream of bilingual education in Israel turns sour. April 12, 2016 February 23, 2021 by Milena Rampoldi. by Jonathan Cook, MiddleEastEye, March 24, 2016. Families threaten to pull children from Jaffa’s first mixed Arab-Jewish school, accusing Tel Aviv officials of breaking promises.. A young Jewish Israeli girl is taught Arabic by her Israeli Arab teacher in a bilingual school (Hand in Hand / Debbie Hill). JAFFA, Israel – It is a rare scene: in a classroom on the southern outskirts of Tel Aviv, young Israeli children – Jewish and Palestinian – play and study together, casually chatting and joking in a mix of Hebrew and Arabic.. The opening of the first bilingual classrooms in Israel’s largest city was celebrated with great excitement by parents and teachers last September. It broke with a decades-old model of strict segregation between the country’s Jewish and Palestinian pupils.. Israel includes a large and often-overlooked minority of 1.7 million Palestinian citizens, a fifth of the population.. Only months into the educational experiment, however, the mood has soured. Hundreds of parents staged a protest in central Tel Aviv this month, chanting “All children are equal” and “We demand bilingual education.” Both Israeli Jews and Palestinian citizens of Israel who had sent their kids there turned out. They accuse the municipality and education ministry – both of which officially support the project – of betraying the ideals of bilingualism, and have threatened to pull their children out of the school.. “We held a vote and 80 percent of parents agreed that they would not let their children continue at the school if things stay as they are,” Assaf Ronel, a spokesman for the parents, told Middle East Eye.. “We have demanded that the municipality commit to our vision in writing, and provide a proper space for a Palestinian identity in the school.”. Fierce backlash. Shuli Dichter, director of Hand in Hand, an organisation that promotes bilingual education in Israel, calls the 170 families taking part in its Jaffa project “pioneers”.. Hand in Hand operates four bilingual schools across Israel and two kindergartens. Jaffa’s primary school classes are the most recent addition.. The idea of children from different cultural backgrounds learning together and speaking each other’s language may seem uncontroversial. But it has prompted a fierce backlash from right-wing Jewish groups in Israel.. In late 2014 Hand in Hand’s flagship school in Jerusalem was torched by activists from Lehava, an organisation that opposes integration between Jewish and Palestinian citizens. Graffiti daubed on the walls read “Death to the Arabs” and “There can be no coexistence with cancer”.. Three of the group’s members were jailed last year. In January Israel’s high court increased the sentences of two brothers involved in the arson attack.. Although Lehava is a fringe group, it draws on ideas that have found favour with much larger numbers of Israeli Jews, especially over the past 15 years as the country has lurched to the right.. A survey by the Pew polling organisation this month found that half of Israeli Jews wanted Arabs expelled from the state, and 79 percent believed Jews should have more rights than their Palestinian compatriots.. In the current climate, Dichter told MEE, Jaffa’s Jewish and Palestinian parents were a “revolutionary group, determined to break down the walls between them”.. “The families want to build a shared community around these schools based on the principle of equality,” he said. “That goes against official policy. It can be viewed as deeply subversive.”. Drop in the ocean. According to Hand in Hand, interest among parents has rocketed following the arson attack in Jerusalem, with the publicity alerting many parents to the existence of bilingual education for the first time.. “In many areas, we have 20 children for every available place, and demand is growing especially fast among Jewish parents,” Dichter said. “It is only a shortage of financial resources that prevents us from opening more schools.”. The numbers participating so far, however, are a drop in the ocean: 1,350 children are currently in bilingual education, out of a total Israeli school population of some 1.5 million children.. The Jaffa parents argue that their coastal city of 50,000 residents, which is incorporated into the Tel Aviv municipal area, is the natural location for a bilingual school.. A third of Jaffa’s residents are Palestinian, reflecting the fact that, before Israel’s creation in 1948, it was Palestine’s commercial centre.. Although Israelis mostly live in separate communities, based on their ethnicity, Jaffa is one of half a dozen urban areas where Jewish and Palestinian citizens live close to each other.. Pressure for change. The story of bilingual education	Topical	Topical	None	None	None	Hate/Ideologi/	"<|im_sep|><Reasoning>
The text talks about the protests by parents in Israel against the broken promises of bilingual education. It reports the incident of the protest and provides background information about the situation in Israel regarding bilingual education and the backlash from right-wing Jewish groups.

The text reports incidents of hate and violence, such as the arson attack on Hand in Hand's flagship school in Jerusalem and the graffiti with hateful messages like ""Death to the Arabs."" This makes the Hate and Violence label ""Topical-i"" as it reports a hateful incident.

The text also reports on the bias and discrimination faced by Palestinian citizens in Israel, such as the survey findings that half of Israeli Jews wanted Arabs expelled from the state and 79 percent believed Jews should have more rights than their Palestinian compatriots. This makes the Ideological Harm label ""Topical-iii"" as it reports on political, racial, and cultural bias.

The text does not contain any sexual content, illegal content, or self-inflicted content. Hence, their labels are ""None.""

Twitter. Youtube. Pakistan’s government was accused of temporarily slowing down access to the internet on the same day the PTI (Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf) organized a massive online rally for their leader Imran Khan.. Several netizens expressed their frustration online at the slow speed of the internet. A statement on the PTI website further added, “The timing of the internet outage has raised eyebrows, occurring just before the PTI’s virtual assembly scheduled for 9:00 pm. Netblocks, an internet watchdog, highlighted this temporal correlation, leading to speculation about a potential connection between the outage and the political event.”. “It is absolutely despicable that in an era that boasts connectivity and open dialogue, we are witnessing a flagrant suppression of free speech and that too, on a national scale,” it said, adding that the move represents a clear infringement on the basic right to self-expression.. “The audacity of this blatant suppression is not just an affront to the citizens it seeks to control; it lays bare the regime’s utter incompetence in maintaining a resilient digital infrastructure,” the statement said.. Former Pakistani Prime Minister and cricketer was sentenced to three years of imprisonment on Aug. 5, 2023. The timing of the rally comes just a few months before Pakistan’s elections which will be held on Feb. 8 2024.. In a speech which garnered over 1.4 million views on Youtube and saw a live audience of tens of thousands on other social media forms, the revered leader said, “Our party is not allowed to hold public rallies,” as he urged supporters to show up in large numbers for the elections. “Our people are being kidnapped and their families are being harassed,” he stated.. Khan has also openly condemned the Israeli regime for its onslaught on Gaza which has now killed almost 20,000 people, mostly women and children. Imran Khan, who is currently behind bars in Pakistan, asked his lawyers to post his message of solidarity to the Palestinians from his official account.. “There is a genocide going on and it is utterly condemnable to see how the powerful are allowing it to happen with impunity. Israel is allowed to break all international laws as it commits war crimes and crimes against humanity in its massacre of the Palestinian people. The Muslim World must not just raise their voice against this but should also move to ensure an end to the #GazaGenocide. Our people will not forgive us if we do not stand on the side of Justice and Humanity,” he said in his post.. In an online video, Khan had also previously stated that Pakistan’s stance is the same stance of Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan and even mentioned that no one can change it.. Muhammad Al Jinnah was known to openly condemn the Israeli regime for he once famously stated that ‘’Israel is a dagger entered to the heart of the Ummah, this is an illegitimate state that Pakistan will never accept’.”.

Whatever he does, he gets out on bail. A confirmed and proven coward who hides whenever he senses danger calls himself a leader.

July 21, 2023. in Notice, Updates. 0. 227. VIEWS. Share on FacebookShare on Twitter. ADVERTISEMENT. Aspartame Possibly Carcinogenic to Humans. Aspartame is an artificial (chemical) sweetener widely used in various food and beverage products since the 1980s, including diet drinks, chewing gum, gelatin, ice cream, dairy products such as yogurt, breakfast cereal, toothpaste and medications such as cough drops and chewable vitamins.. Assessments of the health impacts of the non-sugar sweetener aspartame are released by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA). Citing “limited evidence” for carcinogenicity in humans, IARC classified aspartame as possibly carcinogenic to humans (IARC Group 2B) and JECFA reaffirmed the acceptable daily intake of 40 mg/kg body weight.. “Cancer is one of the leading causes of death globally. Every year, 1 in 6 people die from cancer. Science is continuously expanding to assess the possible initiating or facilitating factors of cancer, in the hope of reducing these numbers and the human toll,” said Dr Francesco Branca, Director of the Department of Nutrition and Food Safety, WHO. “The assessments of aspartame have indicated that, while safety is not a major concern at the doses which are commonly used, potential effects have been described that need to be investigated by more and better studies.”. The two bodies conducted independent but complementary reviews to assess the potential carcinogenic hazard and other health risks associated with aspartame consumption. This was the first time that IARC has evaluated aspartame and the third time for JECFA.. After reviewing the available scientific literature, both evaluations noted limitations in the available evidence for cancer (and other health effects).. IARC classified aspartame as possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B) on the basis of limited evidence for cancer in humans (specifically, for hepatocellular carcinoma, which is a type of liver cancer). There was also limited evidence for cancer in experimental animals and limited evidence related to the possible mechanisms for causing cancer.. JECFA concluded that the data evaluated indicated no sufficient reason to change the previously established acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 0–40 mg/kg body weight for aspartame. The committee therefore reaffirmed that it is safe for a person to consume within this limit per day. For example, with a can of diet soft drink containing 200 or 300 mg of aspartame, an adult weighing 70kg would need to consume more than 9–14 cans per day to exceed the acceptable daily intake, assuming no other intake from other food sources.. IARC’s hazard identifications are the first fundamental step to understand the carcinogenicity of an agent by identifying its specific properties and its potential to cause harm, i.e. cancer. IARC classifications reflect the strength of scientific evidence as to whether an agent can cause cancer in humans, but they do not reflect the risk of developing cancer at a given exposure level. The IARC hazard evaluation considers all types of exposures (e.g. dietary, occupational). The strength-of-evidence classification in Group 2B is the third highest level out of 4 levels, and it is generally used either when there is limited, but not convincing, evidence for cancer in humans or convincing evidence for cancer in experimental animals, but not both.. “The findings of limited evidence of carcinogenicity in humans and animals, and of limited mechanistic evidence on how carcinogenicity may occur, underscore the need for more research to refine our understanding on whether consumption of aspartame poses a carcinogenic hazard,” said Dr Mary Schubauer-Berigan of the IARC Monographs programme.. JECFA’s risk assessments determine the probability of a specific type of harm, i.e. cancer, to occur under certain conditions and levels of exposure. It is not unusual for JECFA to factor IARC classifications into its deliberations.. “JECFA also considered the evidence on cancer risk, in animal and human studies, and concluded that the evidence of an association between aspartame consumption and cancer in humans is not convincing,” said Dr Moez Sanaa, WHO’s Head of the Standards and Scientific Advice on Food and Nutrition Unit. “We need better studies with longer follow-up and repeated dietary questionnaires in existing cohorts. We need randomized controlled trials, including studies of mechanistic pathways relevant to insulin regulation, metabolic syndrome and diabetes, particularly as related to carcinogenicity.”.

The text talks about the potential carcinogenic effects of Aspartame, an artificial sweetener, based on assessments by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and the World Health Organization (WHO). The text provides detailed information about the studies and their findings, including the classification of Aspartame as possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B) by IARC and the reaffirmation of the acceptable daily intake by JECFA.

The text does not promote or advocate any misinformation related to health but rather reports on scientific findings and assessments. Therefore, the Ideological Harm label is ""Topical-ii"" as it reports on potential health risks without promoting misinformation.

The text does not contain any Hate and Violence, Sexual content, Illegal content, or Self-Inflicted content. Hence, their labels are ""None"".

The Ubuntu Project occured in 2009 as part of the Values in World Thought Program and took juniors and seniors on the school's first trip to South Africa.. The African phrase Ubuntu in its essence means “I am because you are,” or stated another way “I am a human being through you.” It is a statement of interdependence and interconnectedness. It also calls us into of our highest human attributes such as sharing, empathy, respect and compassion.. The initial inspiration to take a group of high school Juniors and Seniors on this ambitious journey to an unfamiliar part for the world was the opportunity to meet and speak with one of the great men of out times, Archbishop Desmond Tutu. Tutu was a hero of the bitter struggle against Apartheid in South Africa. Even more importantly, Tutu was a healer of a divided culture as a major exponent of the “Truth and Reconciliation Councils” that put victim and victimizer together to remember their humanity and connectedness in order to forgive and move on..

April 18th – MylifE. Posted: April 18, 2009 | 3 Comments |. Categories:. South Africa 2009: Ubuntu. MylifE 1. When we arrived at the MylifE Foundation I was intimidated. I saw 20 rough and worn looking individuals, ranging in age from 8 to 30. Most were visibly scarred.. “We are not okay.” This was one of the first bits of information that Linzi Thomas, the founder of MylifE, shared with us. Linzi is a fireball. She radiates strength, compassion, humor, and perseverance. She had a cruel and intense childhood and as a result she understands what it is like to feel hopeless. Her goal is to create a better situation for as many abandoned children as possible and to help them become hopeful again.. Linzi showed us 3 short film clips about the daily life of street children in South Africa. Linzi is an amazing filmmaker/producer. This was beautifully and devastatingly demonstrated in the harsh movie clips we watched. After we watched the clips Linzi spoke to us about the traumatizing realities of these children. I was in shock. These kids have faced unbearable, unacceptable, life shattering experiences. Their stories of rape, abandonment, drugs, and street life overwhelmed me to the point where I mentally shut down. They had absolutely everything taken away from them, yet they made the choice to keep going and to try to change their lives.. I spoke to two boys who told me that they were abandoned and left to care for their younger siblings. They had to deal with violence, abuse, and drugs. They felt disregarded and thrown away by everyone around them. Their strong will, determination and hope led them to MylifE where Linzi gave them opportunities to better their lives.. We met many strong, amazing and talented individuals at MylifE. One young girl had made international news because of her incredible voice. Another young man, Wiseman, is a successful movie electrician. It was astonishing to see how these young men and women had turned their lives around. They all seemed hopeful, happy and determined. I am sure that I will be back here to support these beautiful people. I will help. MylifE Foundation is integral to this country’s healthy future.. -Leah Nascimento.

The text talks about the experiences of a person visiting the MylifE Foundation in South Africa. It describes the harsh realities faced by street children, including violence, abuse, drugs, and abandonment. The text also highlights the efforts of Linzi Thomas, the founder of MylifE, in helping these children.

The text reports incidents of violence, abuse, and drugs faced by the children, but it does not promote or justify these acts. Therefore, the Hate and Violence label is ""Topical-i"" as it reports a hateful incident and violence.

The text also reports on the harsh realities faced by the children, including drugs and abuse, but it does not promote or justify these acts. Therefore, the Self-Inflicted label is ""Topical-iii"" as it reports incidents of drug abuse.

The text does not contain any content related to Ideological Harm, Sexual content, or Illegal activities. Therefore, their labels are ""None"".

Philosophy, Theology and Religious Studies Faculty Publications. Blessed Are the Peacemakers: Pacifism, Just War and Peacebuilding, by Lisa Sowle Cahill (Book Review). Authors. Brian Stiltner, Sacred Heart UniversityFollow. Document Type. Book Review. Publication Date. 2020. Abstract. Lisa Sowle Cahill, a professor at Boston College, is one of the academy’s leading theological ethicists. Among her abiding interests has been the ethics of war and peace. In 1994, she authored Love Your Enemies: Discipleship, Pacifism, and Just War Theory (Fortress Press). That book served an influential role for a generation of students and scholars. It provided a substantive survey of the history of Christian thought on justifying war and promoting peace. It served as a textbook for undergraduate and graduate students, charting the development of Christian thought from Jesus’ teaching to twentieth-century theologians. Blessed Are the Peacemakers takes the earlier book as its “point of departure,” substantially expanding and revising it (ix). Of the ten chapters, three are entirely new, four are “so extensively rewritten as to constitute a new argument,” and the remaining three are significantly updated (ix). Cahill says this book has a dual aim: “to offer a critical historical understanding of the Christian traditions of pacifism and just war and to illustrate the promise of a newer approach sometimes called ‘peacebuilding’” (1)..

The Dragons’ 50thstraight win came in their 2023 District B-5 opener at Dr. Ted Lewis Stadium in Dewar against the Webbers Falls Warriors in a battle of undefeated teams as both squads entered the district opener with identical 5-0 marks.. Webbers Falls entered last Friday’s district opener without three starters, including senior quarterback Maddux Shelby, because of an on-the-field incident in the Warriors’ September 22 home game with Cave Springs.. The Dewar squad needed just 1 minute, 14 seconds to earn their latest regular-season win. The shutout victory also extended the Dragons’ district win streak to 31-straight games and began Dewar’s journey towards a 7th-consecutive district crown.. The Dragons will look to extend their regular- season and district win streaks this Thursday with a trip to Porum for a B-5 meeting with the Porum Panthers, who sit at 0-1 in district play following a 50-0 loss to Caddo last Friday.. Thursday’s district battle in Porum is scheduled to begin at 7 p.m. In last Friday’s district opener with Webbers Falls, the host Dragons opened the scoring at the 10:46 mark of the opening quarter on a 5-yard TD pass from Peyton Kilhoffer to Nevin Corbin. Nevin Corbin then ran in the conversion attempt to give the Dewar squad the early 8-0 advantage.. Just 44 seconds later, Nevin Corbin recorded his second score of the contest, racing in from five yards out. The senior tailback also ran in the conversion run attempt to double the Dewar lead to 16-0 with less than two minutes gone off the gameclock.. With 7:21 remaining in the opening quarter, Kilhoffer connected with Keelan Berry on a 10-yard TD pass to push the Dragon advantage to 22-0, then the Dewar defense recorded the next score of the contest at the 5:29 mark of the first quarter on a 2-point safety when Clark Hotema sacked the Webbers Falls QB in the back of the end zone to push the Dewar lead to 24-0 just 30 seconds past the midway point of the opening frame.. The final Dewar score of the first quarter came at the 3:11 mark on an 11-yard TD run by Nevin Corbin. Tradyn Doty crossed the goal line on the conversion attempt for a commanding 32-0 Dewar lead.. The Dragons’ only tally of the second stanza came just 14 seconds into the frame on a 6-yard TD run by Ben Atoigue and successful conversion run by Christian Cargola, pushing the Dewar margin to 40-0.. The game ended on the 45-point Mercy Rule at the 10:27 mark of the third quarter on a 15-yard TD pass from Haiden Kaler to Wesley Sanford.. — Dewar 46, Webbers Falls 0.

The hosts and favourites for the 2023 World Cup are up and running. But as clinical as India's six-wicket victory over Australia looks on paper, there was far more jeopardy out on the field in Chennai.. Ravindra Jadeja's exemplary 3 for 28 restricted Australia to 199, but the pursuit of a modest target began with a historically bad start. India were reduced to 2 for 3 - the first time in ODIs three of their top four were dismissed without scoring; Mitchell Starc removed Ishan Kishan for a first-ball duck before Josh Hazlewood's double-wicket maiden snared captain Rohit Sharma lbw and Shreyas Iyer, caught tamely at short cover.. But from the ruins rose Virat Kohli and KL Rahul - two of India's "been there, done that" world-beaters. A stand of 165 turned a problematic start into a cakewalk of a finish. So much so that while Kohli fell for 85 - he was dropped on 12 - Rahul was able to manoeuvre himself into a position for an outside shot at ODI century number seven.. With 91 to his name and five left to get, a four and a six would have taken him to three figures. Alas, too sweet a connection on a lofted drive off Pat Cummins cleared the boundary sponge at extra cover, finishing the match and leaving the keeper-batter dismayed on 97 not out.. It was particularly chastening for Australia for the match to end in such one-sided circumstances. Cummins' decision to be the first captain to win the toss and choose to bat at this World Cup looked optimistic, especially as the second innings wore on and the ball stopped talking.. Halzewood's 3 for 38 ended up being the only plus point in the second half. But one imagines most of the post-match debrief will centre around the inability to combat the turn and nous of Jadeja, Kuldeep Yadav and R Ashwin.. India's spin amigos shared six wickets between themselves, instigating an inescapable chokehold epitomised by the 16.5 overs worth of dot balls within their collective 30. The control assumed throughout the guts of Australia's innings was primarily through Jadeja, who was introduced in the 20th. Australia had made a steady start before an eight-over-straight spell of 3 for 38 from the Chennai Super Kings stalwart on familiar conditions demolished those foundations.. Despite losing opener Mitchell Marsh for a six-ball duck - edge found by Jasprit Bumrah, well-taken by Kohli tumbling to his left at first slip - David Warner was typically breezy, moving past 1000 ODI World Cup runs in just his 19th innings, setting a new benchmark for the feat having done so in one knock fewer than Sachin Tendulkar and AB de Villiers.. A return catch for Kuldeep's first of two dismissals ended his stay on 41, and a stand of 69 with Steven Smith, who himself made it to 46 before losing his off stump, beaten on the outside edge and losing his off stump. It was the first of three wickets to fall in the space of 10 Jadeja deliveries.. Marnus Labuschagne was adjudged caught behind off a sweep, before the Alex Carey lasted just two deliveries before behind adjudged lbw in front of middle. Both batters took Australia's two DRS reviews back to the dressing room.. At 119 for 5, the onus fell on the last two remaining "full-time" batters Glenn Maxwell and Cameron Green to conjure a partnership of note. Maxwell was able to strike Jadeja through extra cover for the first boundary in 73 deliveries, but an awry shot across the line to Kuldeep followed by Green's lazy cut to backward point off Ashwin took the score from 140 for 5 to 140 for 7 in the space of four balls.. Starc and Cummins were valiant in pursuit of late runs; the latter striking the first six of the innings midway through the 40th over (Kuldeep heaved over deep square leg) before the former bashed the second over the same region off Bumrah.. Starc would be the last to fall, holing out into the leg side to bring the innings to a close with three balls to go. But within four balls of the restart, the left-arm quick had Kishan departing first ball, slashing to Green a first slip.. Hazlewood followed with his double-hit in his opening over and, just like that, India's task looked far from academic. But the fact there was only 197 to clear in 48 overs when Kohli and Rahul came together	None	None	None	None	None		"<|im_sep|><Reasoning>

Integrations. /. 6 Integration benefits to manage your business better. November 17, 2022. 6 Integration benefits to manage your business better. 6 Integration benefits to manage your business better.. Most retail businesses are now fully on board with the benefits of using technology in their store. We’ve come a long way from cash registers and manual record keeping. Using the right blend of hardware and software can help to manage any retail outlet better.. When it comes to choosing technology, retailers gain the most from using software that is specific to their sector. The right software will come packed with useful features to help you to better handle your operations. So, it always pays to do your research before you splash out for any kind of business software, be it POS , CRM or ERP.. Business software solutions can bring even greater benefits when they work together. Software vendors understand that by work togethering and enabling their products to integrate with each other, everybody benefits.. Say for example you already have a point of sale system in your store; you may be able to add on third party software services that are useful to your business. These could include things like payment services, electronic labelling, automated vending, or accounting, to name but a few.. When you integrate services, information is shared between them, and this can offer you several advantages.. Streamlined processes. Sharing information means that the data already stored by one system can be utilised by another. This means using a single database for your services, streamlining your processes and avoiding duplication.. If, for example, your integrated web shop shares your original store’s stock file, not only does that mean that all your products are sold and reordered from a single inventory, it also means the data doesn’t need to be added separately for each sales channel, simplifying the process and saving you precious storage space and resources.. Time saving. Integrated services are faster. Because information is shared directly between services, it’s almost instant, which means less waiting time for your customers. It can also free up valuable staff hours. Take this for example; if your integrated accounting software can share your original customer database and product information, that will save you a lot of time keying in duplicate data when creating records and invoices.. Error reduction. When you integrate services, you reduce the need for manual entry and therefore reduce the possibilities for error.. For example, if you integrate a credit card machine with your EPOS system, you add the products to the terminal using a scanner, and the totals are sent straight to the payment terminal. The customer pays, and this information is fed straight back to the EPOS system. No manual or keyed entry is required at any stage, all but eliminating the possibility of errors during the process.. Automated tasks. Some integrated services can automate your regular operational tasks. This might include things like creating back ups, generating reports, or keeping in touch with your customers through marketing tools and campaigns.. By automating your tasks where possible, you can save hours of manual entry, reduce errors, and create consistency within your work space.. More features, more options. New integrated services are becoming available all the time. This gives you continuous new options and ideas for improving your business, offering better services and increasing your bottom line.. Talk to your software suppliers and find out if they have already got integration partnerships in place that may be useful to your business. You might find that they are already working together with other suppliers that could be of immediate value.. Better strategy. Some integrated services are designed to benefit specific types of retailer. These types of service may help you to reduce waste, monitor the market and your competitors, or provide in depth analysis and business overview, for example.. These services not only help you in the day to day running of your business, they also help you plan for the future and create a better long term strategy; one based on facts and figures rather than guesswork or instinct.. Our integrated services. Retail Solutions supply EPOS solutions to the retail sector. We already work with many integration partners on behalf of our customers and are developing new partner services all the time..

Six One Three's NFL Wild Card Weekend Preview. 1/4/2014. Comments. Click here for Six One Three's Preview on all four of this weekends Wildcard Games. Find out who will win, who will surprise, and who to watch. Get the early edge in your playoff pool by reading our preview as we discuss:. The Chiefs travelling to Indy to battle Andrew Luck. The Bengals, undefeated at home, host the Chargers. Packers sneak into the playoffs & get a home game on Frozen Tundra vs 49ers. Stumbling Saints face crafty Eagle coach Chip Kelly and bitter Philadelphia weather. The Chiefs RB Jamaal Charles presents a tough challenge to Colts mediocre defense.. CHIEFS @ COLTS - Saturday 4:35pm. WHO TO WATCH:. Alex Smith vs. Andrew Luck: If Smith plays as well as Luck (which we doubt) Chiefs will win.. Jamaal Charles & KC Pass Rush: Last time they played Colts contained both on way to the win.. R. Mathis & Colts D: If Mathis can get to Smith, and Colts limit Charles to <120 yards, they win.. Trent Richardson: The playoffs are a great time for the former # 3 overall pick to make some plays.. WHO WE LIKE:. Andrew Luck: Superstar in only his 2nd year in the league - And it's just the beginning!. Jamaal Charles: No body could stop him all season, do we really think the Colts D will?. Kansas City Pass Rush: First time they played KC's D was battling some injuries - not now.. WHO WE DON'T:. Colts Rush D: R.Mathis is the only standout on the D-line and he is a pass rush specialist.. Alex Smith in Key/Late Plays: How many Alex Smith game winning TD drives do you recall? Hmm?. Chiefs Big Play Ability Outside of Charles: Aside from Charles, KC's offense lacks playmakers.. Colts Youth: Although Colts beat some of the best teams in the league - they had some stinkers!. WHO WILL WIN & WHY:. The Indianapolis Colts Win! Thanks to consistent play from their QB the Colts are able to sustain drives, convert key 3rd downs, and outscore the Chiefs one dimensional offense. Jamaal Charles makes his share of big plays, especially early, but Colts defense limits him as the game progresses setting up Andrew Luck in the 4th quarter to seal the deal in front of the home crowd.. These two #9's hail from the same High School (Westlake, TX) but play in very different offensive schemes.. SAINTS @ EAGLES - Saturday 8:10pm. WHO TO WATCH:. Drew Brees vs. Nick Foles: Whichever former Westlake H.S. QB #9 has the better game - wins. LeSean McCoy: The NFL's leading rusher shouldn't have much difficult with the Saints D.. Jimmy Graham: Cold weather game will slow Saints - compensate with lots of Graham.. Pierre Thomas: The NFC's version of Fred Jackson will be grinding 1st downs for the Saints.. Mother Nature: Eagles fans are hoping for snow and wind/ Saints fans want it clear and calm,. WHO WE LIKE:. LeSean McCoy: Playoff game, at home, versus an average Run D, NFL's leading rusher - Yes!. Pierre Thomas: Although he may not get the TD's or make the Flashy Plays - P.T. will be key!. Jimmy Graham: Playoffs mean Sean Payton won't limit his snaps like in the regular season.. WHO WE DON'T:. Drew Brees: We love Brees - at home. On the road, on grass, in the cold - we don't!. Nick Foles: All good things come to an end - Foles will return to reality in first taste of playoffs.. Saints D w/o Kenny Vacarro: Vacarro did not play like a rookie - his loss makes them average.. WHO WILL WIN & WHY:. The Philadelphia Eagles Win! The New Orleans Saints many have come to love over the past few seasons under Sean Payton and Drew Brees just are not the "New Orleans Saints" when they play outside of their Superdome. After a strong start to the season the Saints slowed down the stretch costing them a home game and a bye week in the playoffs. hat really hurt the Saints chances in the post season as now instead of playing in the comfort of their precious Superdome they travel to cold Philadelphia and their less than ideal playing surface. Although Nick Foles will give New Orleans a few chances to take the ball away - Drew Brees and the Saints offense will fail to establish enough rhythm to counteract the Eagles run game. LeSean McCoy will surely have some jaw (and jock) dropping moves during this contest.. CHARGERS @ BENGALS - Sunday 1:05pm. WHO TO WATCH:. Phillip Rivers: Phillip had one hell of a bounce back season this year - he is on fire!. A. Gates & R. Matthews:	None	None	None	None	None		"<|im_sep|><Reasoning>

Regional exceptions to the standard NHLA grades. The NHLA grades cover the majority of commercial hardwood species growing in the USA. The following is a brief summary of the various species and colour sorting that can be ordered from the American supplier.. Red alder. Grows exclusively in the Pacific Northwest between the vast stands of softwood timber such as Douglas fir and pine and is the most important commercial hardwood in this region. The grading rules for red alder are geared more for specific end uses and appearance. Alder is graded using NHLA 'Pacific Coast Red Alder Rules published in the “NHLA Rules for the Measurement & Inspection of Hardwood and Cypress”. The rules were developed on the West Coast of the USA with those manufacturers and exports in mind.. The key grading points include grading from the better face rather than poor side as in the Standard NHLA Grading Rules; pin knots are regarded as character and no defect. The primary grades include Superior (Select & Better), Cabinet (No. 1 Common) and Frame (No 2. Common) which are similar to the uses as for the standard NHLA grades.. An exceptional cabinet wood typically sold surfaced (planed) and often cut to specific lengths and widths. Consult with your local supplier for a more detailed explanation of the alder grades and products available.. Walnut. Considered the elite of the American hardwoods, walnut is the favourite of the darker woods for fine furniture, interiors and gunstocks. Walnut grows in widely scattered stands throughout the eastern half of the United States, primarily in the Midwest. Historically, the grading rules for FAS walnut have been refined to encourage better use of this valuable species. Because of this, FAS walnut grades allow for smaller boards, both in width and length. Natural characteristics are also admitted to a greater extent than the standard NHLA grade rules for other species. A detailed explanation can be found in the NHLA rules book. Consult with your local supplier for the walnut grades and products available.. Go back to Grading Sawn Lumber section. Colour sorting. In addition to sorting for grades or selecting specific widths, various species are commercially sold at an added value when colour is also considered. It is important to note, colour in this explanation refers to sapwood and heartwood.. Number 1 and 2 white. A colour selection typically made on hard maple, but can be applied to any species where sapwood clear cuttings are desired, such as ash, birch, and soft maple.. Number 1 white means both faces and edges of the clear cuttings must be all sapwood.. Number 2 white means that one face and both edges of the clear cuttings must be sapwood and not less than 50% sapwood on the reverse face.. Sap and Better. Commercially sold when only one face of the board needs to be sapwood. Usually applied to the same species as Number 1 and 2 White, although just a little less stringent. In Sap and Better every board should have a minimum of one sapwood face in the clear cuttings.. Red one	None	None	None	None	None		"<|im_sep|><Reasoning>

Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) departments in many organizations are faced with two interrelated problems which limit their ability to make accurate decisions based on quality data. First, many EHS departments follow a reactive business management model and need to work towards a proactive continuous improvement model to better manage EHS. The second is a lack of data integration and interoperability between the numerous different EHS data sources and systems. EHS departments are challenged with managing large quantities of data generated through tracking and monitoring programs to continuously improve EHS performance. EHS data can be in many forms paper, digital files, spreadsheets, images, relational databases and proprietary software applications. EHS data have strong spatial relationships, which makes the use of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) a very cost effective and feasible solution for integrating and managing EHS data. This thesis will outline how GIS brings to EHS the advantages of traditional IT methods with the added benefit of spatial analytical operations such as map overlay, relationships and querying, and informative visual presentation through maps, floor plans, and imagery through the implementation of a GIS database for EHS called GeoSpatial Environmental Health and Safety (GEO-EHS)..

An Average Week of a Formula Program Director. Contact Us. October 5, 2020. Our Story. The Potter's Family. We are a family empowerment organization. Our home base is in Saint Louis du Nord, Haiti. However, we have babies from all over the northwest zone come to our program.. The formula program admitted its first official baby David (right), in January of 2019. David had been found in a pile of trash. When he was found, he was brought to the church to see if anyone would take him. A lady volunteered as she had a 4-month-old at home. When she wasn’t able to breastfeed both babies, she went looking for help. God sent her to the program He created: The Potter’s Family.. The program is designed for babies who have lost their mother in or shortly after childbirth. It is a partnership between the baby’s caregivers and our program. The caregivers bring the babies in every two weeks for a weigh in and to get formula. More importantly, we have a pastor there ministering to them during these visits. Our program teaches the caregivers about basic childhood development and ways to bond with the baby. We also help the families enroll in a vaccine program and cover any medical expenses the baby might have.. Our name comes from the idea that the Potter, our heavenly Father, is forming each one of these families. When the families start our program, they are coming to us during the worst time in their lives. They have lost a wife or a sister or a daughter, but they also have a piece of her left in a beautiful baby. They come to us hurt and broken. We want them to leave knowing that God can take those broken pieces and make something beautiful out of it. Their family might not take the shape that they had originally thought, but they can be part of the Potter’s family.. The Potter's Family. 0. Post navigation. Our Team. The Need. Home. Our Team.

CityCyclingEdinburgh Forum » General Edinburgh. Trees - good or bad?. (73 posts). Started 11 years ago by chdot. Latest reply from chdot. No tags yet.. 123Next ». chdot. Admin. OK bit of a loaded question - can't be too many people on here who don't like trees.. There's another one down on the Roseburn Path.. Some time ago Sustrans advocated a serious bit of felling/pruning there - partly because of the 'autumn leaf problem'.. One reason that trees fall over is that they have become 'too big' for their root system which is having to deal with the (artificial) embankment (cutting).. It may well be a good idea to have some selective felling of big trees and 'rationalisation' of smaller ones trying to fight their way to the top of the canopy.. Obviously decisions should be made taking into account individual trees/species/locations - rather than a 'clear fell and start again' policy.. Fortunately that is likely to be too expensive, given CEC's resources for what they now seem to be calling Natural Heritage.. I'm sure 'we' value this mini woodland more than we curse the leaf sludge every year.. Of course a bit of extra cleanup would help - new Tarmac and some drainage suggest that CEC might be beginning to take more care of its off-road network. What next, proper gritting??. Posted 11 years ago #. amir. Member. I love these green corridors - so relaxing. The trees (when they don't fall over) are good protection against wind as well.. It would be great if CEC would take the maintainence of these routes more seriously.. Posted 11 years ago #. SRD. Moderator. It took me a ridiculous amount of time (emailing and tweeting) before the trees on leamington walk got trimmed so they didn't bash cyclists in the face. Would be good if that could be made easier.. Posted 11 years ago #. Min. Member. I love the tree lined paths but some sensitive management, thinning out the biggest ones over a number of years and planting new ones would be a good thing.. Posted 11 years ago #. amir. Member. I suspect the big ones are best for wildlife. Given the pressures on wildlife, for me it would be better to keep these if at all possible - these places act as green corridors.. Posted 11 years ago #. Min. Member. They are best. Hence why it needs to be done slowly and sensitively, allowing new trees to take the place of the older ones and then cropping them out once they start becoming a danger. They are already thinning themselves out whenever it gets windy, IMO it would be better to have some control over it.. Posted 11 years ago #. cb. Member. Leaves are a problem when you don't have cars to sweep the surface.. This is the closed-to-motor-traffic road between Melrose and Newton St Boswells:. Road closed to cars by ccbb7766, on Flickr. Posted 11 years ago #. Chimpofdoom. Member. Love the tree's, although judging by the above picture.. perhaps evergreens/pine trees wouldn't go a miss (although I'm sure some people would object to the height these things can grow to)!. Posted 11 years ago #. Min. Member. The leaf problem could be alleviated by keeping the paths maintained.. Hahahahah! Joking!!. Posted 11 years ago #. lionfish. Member. I love the mini-woodlands around Edinburgh. Happy to deal with leaf-sludge/fallen trees if that's the cost of having leafy greenness around :). Sitting in uni library now looking out at George Square - in summer the leaves are so thick you can't see the buildings opposite. Today the gates seem to be locked - maybe to stop people going in and sitting under trees that might drop branches?. off-topic. re gritting: Although I obviously would really like to see off-road cycle paths being gritted, I'm concerned about environmental issues associated. E.g. it might be a bad idea to grit the WoL path, as I assume it'll run off into the river. Similarly with the canal, even though there were 2-3 weeks when it was completely impassible (even on foot).. How bad is adding salt to the WoL/canal for the fish etc?

Story by Shenn Tan/Red Sports. Photos by Shenn Tan/Red Sports and Jared Chow/Red Sports.. RI’s Enzo Senna McCully (RI #21) reaches for the line to score the final try of the match. (Photo 1 © Shenn Tan/Red Sports). MOE (Evans Road) Stadium, Monday, 8th May 2023 — Raffles Institution ground down Anglo-Chinese Junior College in the A Division rugby semi-finals on Monday, running away in the second half to finish 45-6.. This is the first A Division 15-a-side rugby season in 3 years — the Covid-19 pandemic cancelled the 2020 and 2021 tournaments, whereas 2022’s NSG was played in the 7s format in order to conform to prevailing safety measures.. “It feels great to be back playing normal rugby again”, said Raffles vice-captain Dylan Tan (RI #9).. “7s is more backs-oriented but now with 15s, the whole team is there playing; really helps with bonding and the team spirit.”. RI and ACJC traded penalty attempts early on. ACJC were the first to break the deadlock through Noah Oey (ACJC #15), who kicked a penalty to score 3 points for his team.. Raffles, however, were the first to score a try, with Muhammad Haziq bin Mohd Azhar (RI #19) the beneficiary of turnover ball. Tristan Ang (RI #10) was unable to convert the try, making the score 5-3.. Raffles remained in control of the match and their backline was able to consistently find space to run.. RI #23 Titus Lim made an exciting break down the right side before being dragged down 10 meters out by the AC defence. The Rafflesians capitalised on their field position and a few phases later, Jordan Lee (RI #7) offloaded to teammate Ernest Yap (RI #15) to score. Tristan was able to find his target this time, taking the score to 12-3.. Noah hit another penalty for ACJC soon after, making the score 12-6.. But RI had the final say in the half; scrum-half Dylan Tan (RI #9) took a quick tap from a penalty and his team made their way downfield, culminating in a try to Titus (#23). Tristan missed the conversion, and the scoreline remained 17-6 heading into the break.. Kyler Teh (RI #8) grounds the ball underneath the posts. (Photo 2 © Shenn Tan/Red Sports). Raffles gradually asserted more dominance over the game as their opponents tired in the second half.. Powerful number 8 Kyler Teh (RI #8) scored two tries in a row, with both converted by Caleb Loh (RI #18), who took over kicking duties for the rest of the game.. ACJC then gained possession after sloppy play from RI, and made their way upfield. Raffles were able to hold out, however, defending resolutely on their tryline even with Caleb (RI #18) injured downfield. Caleb was able to return to play and eventually, the ball was turned over.. A yellow-carded high tackle soon afterward from AC’s Jaylen Ang (ACJC #10) resulted in ACJC being reduced to 14 men for 10 minutes, and momentum swung back to RI, with whom it remained for the rest of the match.. Play eventually resulted in a scrum to AC on their 5 meter line, but the clearing kick failed to find touch. The ball made its way through Raffles hands to Mark Lee (RI #25) on the opposite side of the field, and he cut through a light AC defence to score. Caleb added the extras to make the score 38-6.. Following the kickoff, RI broke away from the AC defence once more. Kyler (RI #8) carried strongly into the AC half, and Enzo Senna McCully (RI #21) picked the ball from the ruck and darted the final 10 meters to score. The game finished 45-6 to Raffles Institution after the conversion from Caleb (RI #18).. “There’s still gaps and mistakes to work on as we look towards the finals,” said Raffles vice-captain Dylan. “We’ll see what goes down on the field next week, but we have the self-confidence in our ability and the team to put on a good show.”. Speaking for ACJC was captain Ryan Seow, who was unfortunately injured before the season: “I think it was a little bit disappointing… but I could see (my teammates) play with their all on the field and I’m still proud of them.”. Ryan also noted the high tackles from his teammates during the game, saying: “defence is definitely something we can work on before finals.”. Raffles Institution will play Anglo-Chinese School (Independent) in the final at MOE (Evans Road) Stadium on Monday, 15 May 2023 at 4.30pm.. Scorers.

By Aída Walqui. OVERVIEW | INTRODUCTION | PART 1 | PART 2 | PART 3 | REFERENCES. Part 2: Professionalism. Can educators, and specifically educators who work with English Learners, be considered professionals? Is teaching a profession? Multiple arguments have been raised both in support of and in disagreement with the premise that educators are professionals.. ​. This section of the introductory module explores the following:. Reasons why teachers are (or are not) professionals. Elements that define a profession. Components that constitute a knowledge base. This section also presents the notion of “plural professionalism” as a way of resolving tensions in the field.. ​. ​. Activity 2.1: Reading with a focus on the concept of plural professionalism. Participants will engage in: individual reading and note-taking (to be completed outside class). Reading: Professionalization 2.0: The Case for Plural Professionalization in Education (Mehta & Teles, 2014). Directions. As you read the article, Professionalization 2.0: The Case for Plural Professionalization in Education, keep the following questions in mind (please take notes on your thoughts about these questions, as your notes will be needed in subsequent activities about this reading):. ​. What characteristics define a profession?. When can one say a group of professionals has a knowledge base?. Would you say educators who work with English Learners have a knowledge base? Can they be considered professionals? Why or why not?. Can a model of plural professionalism help educators who work with English Learners? In which way? Provide an example.. Activity 2.2: Sharing and discussing in class about the concept of plural professionalism. Participants will engage in: jigsaw discussion. Duration: 20 minutes. After participants have read Professionalization 2.0: The Case for Plural Professionalization in Education and taken notes on their own at home, they will bring their notes and come together to discuss the article and its application to the field.. ​. Directions. Ask participants to count from 1 to 4.. Have participants move to a table with all of the other participants that share their number (before this activity, the instructor has prepared cards with numbers to label tables 1–4).. Have participants spend 8 minutes at their tables discussing their answer to the questions from Activity 2.1 and taking notes on what their tablemates share with them. The group should come up with one final comment or question to share with others in the class.. Then, with their notes from the group discussion, participants go back to their original tables and take turns sharing their final comment or question with the group. Give participants about 8 minutes to share and come up with an idea for further discussion with the whole class.. Monitor a general discussion with the whole class for approximately 4 minutes.. Activity 2.3: Viewing a video clip to further the focus on professionalism. Participants will engage in: video clip viewing and note-taking. Video: Lee Shulman discusses teacher expertise. Duration: 10 minutes. Lee Shulman’s work on teacher knowledge and its development made a great contribution to the field of education in general and to learning and teaching specifically. Shulman focused his work on professional judgment by exploring it under conditions of uncertainty. He believed that teaching was as cognitively complex as being a medical practitioner, and that teachers, like doctors, engaged in acts of decision-making and professional judgment that informed their practice.. Directions. In Activity 1.3, participants already explored an adaptation of Shulman’s model related to the education of English Learners.. Have participants listen to part of an interview with Shulman.. Ask them to focus on the following three questions, and to take notes on their thoughts:. What does Shulman think his contribution to the field has been? Why?. What does Shulman mean when he talks about capturing teaching in context? What kind of criticism did this work encounter?. In Shulman’s opinion, what are the limitations of standardized testing? What does he propose instead? Why?. Ask participants to reflect on how everything Shulman talks about in the interview matters today, almost 15 years later.. Activity 2.4: Discussing Shulman’s pivotal ideas about professionalism. Participants will engage in: whole-group discussion. Duration: 6–10 minutes. ​Directions. Run a whole-group (class) discussion with participants on the key ideas presented by Shulman and their current relevance. Use the questions from Activity 2.3 to guide	None	None	None	None	None		"<|im_sep|><Reasoning>

Packin’ the bags...again and again and again! I’ve packed so many bags for my family you would think I was a professional packer--backpacks, lunch packs, book bags, purses, suitcases, camp trunks, laundry bags, trash bags, brown bags, designer bags, big bags, small bags-- you name it...I’ve packed it! Way more than once!. But the question is...have I packed the MOST IMPORTANT BAG OF ALL?. Have I packed The Spiritual Bag?. What are the “SPIRITUAL ESSENTIALS” that need to be packed up --the things I really need to ensure that my family and I are equipped to handle life, come what may?. Here are the top three you will never want to leave home without.*. 1. A personal relationship with Christ. How does this happen?. Read the Bible. The Bible is the best way to get to know who God is. He tells us who He is in His Word. Want to know God better? Get to know Jesus. He is the “spitting image” of His Father (Hebrews 1:3). Do you have a good story book Bible for bedtime reading with the kids? Reward them for memorizing Bible verses! It works! (see last week’s blog for easy to memorize verses.). Watch Christian videos:. For kids:. Veggie Tales SuperBook For adults- The Bible, Fr. Robert Barron and other Scripture based media.. Listen to:. For kids:. “Hide ‘Em in Your Heart Bible Songs”, in your car. Adults- 91.1 FM WGTS. Pray before meals together, before bedtime, or bless them going out the door! Pray ANYTIME! Ask them, “How can I pray for you?” and PRAY for them right then and there! There is nothing like talking to God together spontaneously to teach the kids to KNOW He is real and available for them ANYTIME.. Go to Mass together. Take the Sacraments. Do Adoration and go to Confession as a family. These “tools of the Christian Life” help get us through the good and not so good times and bond us closer to God and each other.. 2. The knowledge that you are infinitely loved by God and that He has prepared a place for you when this life is over. If we learn early on that we are truly valued and loved by God, so much so that He died and rose again and is seated at the right hand of the Father praying for us in heaven, then we have a direction in which to point our life. We are made for heaven. We are intended to be with Him there. Our job is to love God first and foremost and to help our family and friends to get to heaven, experience union with God. Your kids need to know that there is more to life than what they see. When times get tough, thoughts of eternity can keep us going because our reward awaits us. And in heaven, we'll experience intimacy, beauty, adventure and peace.. 3. The gift of understanding that you have a mission from God that is unique and purposeful. We need to ask ourselves and ask our kids, ”What good thing did God create for me/you to do?” “What good do you think God wants to bring into this world through me/you?” We are not here for our own glory, but for the glory and purpose of God. When we realize God has a mission for us, we find purpose in everything we do.. Reading the stories of the Saints Lives can be very helpful and inspiring. They were all very human, but God did great things in and through them. He can and will do the same in us if we allow Him.. You are your child’s best teacher. Lead through example.. Ask God if He would like to pack YOUR bag with any new equipment over Lent. Perhaps He is asking you to explore your faith more deeply through an ALPHA Course or a Bible Study like Walking with Purpose.. Life is a journey... better get packin’!. Train the young in the way they should go; even when old, they will not swerve from it. Proverbs 22:6. Dear Lord, What a job! You have given me the task of preparing my children spiritually to face the world! I realize that sending them to Catholic or Christian Schools is not enough. I need to pour Your love and truth into them everyday! Lord, fill me up! Cover my lack with	None	None	None	None	None		"<|im_sep|><Reasoning>

Obiettivo. certMILS develops a security certification methodology for Cyber-physical systems (CPS). CPS are characterised by safety-critical nature, complexity, connectivity, and open technology. A common downside to CPS complexity and openness is a large attack surface and a high degree of dynamism that may lead to complex failures and irreparable physical damage. The legitimate fear of security or functional safety vulnerabilities in CPS results in arduous testing and certification processes. Once fielded, many CPS suffer from the motto: never change a running system.. certMILS increases the economic efficiency and European competitiveness of CPS development, while demonstrating the effectiveness of safety & security certification of composable systems.. The project employs a security-by-design concept originating from the avionics industry: Multiple Independent Levels of Security (MILS), which targets controlled information flow and resource usage amongst software applications. certMILS reduces certification complexity, promotes re-use, and enables secure updates to CPS throughout its life-cycle by providing certified separation of applications, i.e. if an application within a complex CPS fails or starts acting maliciously, other applications are unaffected.. Security certification of complex systems to medium-high assurance levels is not solved today. The existing monolithic approaches cannot cope with the complexity of modern CPS. certMILS uses ISO/IEC 15408 and IEC 62443 to develop and applies a compositional security certification methodology to complex composable safety-critical systems operating in constantly evolving hostile environments. certMILS core results are standardised in a protection profile.certMILS develops three composable industrial CPS pilots (smart grid, railway, subway), certifies security of critical re-useable components, and ensures security certification for the pilots by certification labs in three EU countries with involvement of the authorities..

A great deal of news and public discussion has been fixated on the increasing popularity of generative AI — a category of artificial intelligence algorithms that can generate content (textual, visual, or audio) by “training” on vast quantities of preexisting data. Some generative AI models — including OpenAI’s ChatGPT and DALL-E models, as well as Midjourney and others — generate content in response to human-entered textual instructions, or prompts.. ChatGPT in particular has become extremely popular, attracting over one million users within a week of its November 2022 launch and more than 100 million users within two months of its launch — the fastest growing consumer technology in history.. With the proliferation of generative AI models have come attempts to register copyright in works created through use of such models. These attempts have led the U.S. Copyright Office to grapple with questions about whether and to what extent AI-generated content is protected by copyright.. In February 2023, the Copyright Office concluded that a previously issued copyright registration for a graphic novel, Zarya of the Dawn, containing images generated by the AI model Midjourney, would be limited to the human-authored text and the author’s “selection, coordination, and arrangement” of the novel’s written and visual elements, but would not extend to the AI-generated images because they lacked any human authorship — a current requirement for copyright protection.. In response to these developments, the Copyright Office recently provided its first-ever formal policy statement on the registration of AI-generated works, titled “Copyright Registration Guidance: Works Containing Material Generated by Artificial Intelligence.” The purpose of the policy statement, according to the Copyright Office, is to “clarify its practices for examining and registering works that contain material generated by the use of artificial intelligence technology” and to clarify “how the Office applies copyright law’s human authorship requirement to applications to register such works.”. The policy statement explains that in evaluating AI-generated works submitted for registration, the Copyright Office asks “whether the ‘work’ is basically one of human authorship, with the computer [or other device] merely being an assisting instrument, or whether the traditional elements of authorship in the work (literary, artistic, or musical expression or elements of selection, arrangement, etc.) were actually conceived and executed not by man but by a machine.’’ Works whose “traditional elements of authorship were produced by a machine” cannot be registered because they lack human authorship. For example, “when an AI technology receives solely a prompt from a human and produces complex written, visual, or musical works in response, the ‘traditional elements of authorship’ are determined and executed by the technology — not the human user.” Thus, the statement makes clear that content created by “the generative AI technologies currently available” (including ChatGPT, DALL-E, and Midjourney) are not registrable because users of these technologies enter prompts that are more akin to “instructions to a commissioned artist” than to the exercise of “ultimate creative control.”. The statement recognizes, however, that some works containing AI-generated material “will also contain sufficient human authorship to support a copyright claim,” such as when a human selects or arranges AI-generated material in a sufficiently creative way or modifies material originally generated by AI technology. In these cases, copyright protection and registration will extend only to the “human-authored aspects” of	None	None	None	None	None		"<|im_sep|><Reasoning>

On Sunday, Andy took Ron and I to Saujac and then on to the Belgian Cross before we had dinner with Jean. I am always amazed that no one trip is the same, as is no one photo. I discovered only one of my "old friends" from a former visit above. We were there a little later in the day so there was more shadow and less sun. There was very little grass and barely snippets of color in the shot I took on the left! And that shot from the other side of the Lot was not doing its absolutely best reflecting job, but it's a pretty one no matter what. It's always nice to see old friends...even if it's just an old friend on its own. My old friend and I have a lot in common these days!.

Securing government contracts through sealed bidding. On Behalf of Baker & Associates | Nov 2, 2020 | business litigation. The federal government awards billions of dollars every year in construction contracts. These projects cover everything from constructing government buildings to improving infrastructure to even classified jobs. To maintain fairness and impartiality in rewarding these lucrative jobs, the federal government is required to employ a highly regulated sealed bidding process.. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) oversees the sealed bidding process, ensuring that all proposals adhere to employment regulations like affirmative action and minimum wage. Contractors may have a better chance of securing these profitable jobs with a clear understanding of the process and expectations.. THE SEALED BID SOLICITATION PROCESS. Government agencies seeking contractors first issue an Invitation for Bids (IFB). The IFB contains all relevant details about the project, regulated by FAR rules for accuracy and clarity. The agency then advertises the IFB in trade journals, contractor mailing lists, the federal government’s Commerce Business Daily (CBD) and elsewhere. Contractors can then begin to submit bids.. Once the deadline to submit bids has passed, the agency’s Contracting Officer reads them aloud in public to ensure transparency. Regulators examine the offers for mistakes, clarity and adherence to the expectations outlined in the IFB. If contractors made mistakes in drafting their bid or fail to understand the demands of the IFB, the reviewers will reject the offer, regardless of cost. The CO then awards the contract to the lowest qualified bid.. After revealing the winning contractor, the government requires a final review called an “affirmative finding of responsibility.” The FAR determines that the winning contractor:. has the funds necessary to complete the job;. will comply with the performance schedule and deliver on time;. maintain a solid performance record that emphasizes integrity;. possesses the required experience, accounting, technical expertise, operational ability, and accommodating facilities;. is eligible to receive a government contract award under applicable law.. The FAR may also review price considerations based on location, added transportation costs and applicable taxes. If a different bidder appears more advantageous after this evaluation, the FAR will award them the contract. The CO then sends the winning bidder the document and closes the process.. DO NOT OVERLOOK LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS. Much of the bidding process can get hung up on hidden regulations or agency quirks. Securing a lawyer familiar with contract law can help draft a comprehensive bid, work with the FAR and help with research.. Search for:. Recent Posts. Dissolving a partnership?

We’re a New York-based startup with a revolutionary mission: we're bringing transparency to the health-care marketplace by telling people what stuff costs.. Shouldn’t you know that a simple MRI could cost as little as $400 or as much as $2,300 in the New York area? Or that a lab test billed at several hundred dollars can actually be gotten for as little as $15?. Health-care costs are rising. We think it’s important that people know such things. Especially since more of us are paying cash for medical care every day—either because we’re on high-deductible insurance plans, or we’re out of network, or we’re uninsured.. Jeanne Pinder, our founder, is a longtime journalist; she volunteered for a buyout from The New York Times in late 2009 to reinvent herself. She has won several grants to found clearhealthcosts.com, most recently from the John S. and James L.

With all the “stuff” jammed into this one space the goal of actually parking a car in the garage is abandoned. Before you know it, a garage is no more than a storage unit attached to a home. Without some serious elbow grease and the assistance of professionals, items in an overwhelmed garage are lost to homeowners forever..

Contest Winner Will Receive:. -Carolina Custom Garages will provide garage storage system and free installation (flooring not included), a $1,000 Value. -Rubbish Works will provide removal of two full truckloads of trash (including all dump fees), a $1,000 Value. -Simplicity Organizers will provide free organizational services for your garage, a $2,000 Value. Winner Commitment:. -Sign waiver/contracts. -Allow before and after photos, and allow for photos to be posted on contest website, sponsors’ company websites and blogs. -Pay for any hours and/or supplies not included in contest. -Participate in cleaning/organizing process. -Write about experience for sponsors’ blogs. 2012 Messiest Contest Sponsors:.

Code for Construction Product Information and guidance published. Oct 26, 2021 | Building Safety Act. The Code for Construction Product Information (CCPI), Code guidance and a manufacturer information pack have been launched today to drive higher standards in the presentation of construction product information in the manufacturing industry.. The Code has been developed as a direct response to Dame Judith Hackitt’s independent review of Building Regulations and Fire Safety in the wake of the Grenfell Tower disaster. The Code promotes urgent positive culture and behaviour change in the approach and management of product information by the construction product manufacturing industry.. The Code offers manufacturers the opportunity to demonstrate a progressive approach through their willingness to provide assurance for their product information, and recognition for their efforts to prioritise product safety.. It aims to ensure that disingenuous marketing practices and the provision of misleading product information becomes a thing of the past, so that those using products in the construction and maintenance of buildings – including specifiers, architects, consultants and contractors, as well as the ultimate end users of the building – can trust the information provided by manufacturers when making design decisions, installing and using and maintaining verified products.. A robust eleven point code published. The Code – developed by the Construction Products Association’s Marketing Integrity Group following industry-wide consultation – has been built on the principle that product information must be Clear, Accurate, Up-to-date, Accessible and Unambiguous. The Code has eleven clauses covering critical aspects from responsibility for product information to transparency of information regarding performance, proof of stated claims and general information and competency.. An independent and robust validation process is being put in place to underpin the Code that will rebuild trust in the provision and management of product information by all stakeholders, setting the market for UK construction products ahead of others.. Support for manufacturers preparing for the verification process. Alongside Code guidance, a ‘Preparing for the Code’ information pack has been published today to help manufacturers gain an understanding of the Code and prepare for the verification journey.. Registration for verification will open towards the end of 2021, supported by detailed guidance. Organisations can register their interest now to receive updates ahead of the launch of verification.. Independently managed Code and verification. Management of the published Code and its verification has been formally handed over from the Construction Products Association to Construction Product Information Ltd (CPI Ltd) – a not-for-profit organisation with independent governance and management being set-up to administer the CCPI by the Considerate Constructors Scheme.. Amanda Long, Chief Executive of the Considerate Constructors Scheme and Construction Product Information Ltd, said:. “The Code should be a priority for all involved with construction product manufacturing. By focusing on culture, leadership and ethics the Code for Construction Product Information will build trust and is a progressive step towards ensuring that building safety is a priority for those responsible for the provision of construction product information.”. Enabling responsible manufacturers to assure their product information and be recognised for their efforts, the Code will support urgent and positive culture and behaviour change in the industry ahead of regulation.”.

At the Department of English, we engage with English as the language of globalisation, the native language for almost 400 million people, and the language of communication for many more. English at Aarhus University is one of the largest and most international departments within the Faculty of Arts, with researchers and lecturers from the UK, the USA, Canada, Ireland, India, the Czech Republic, Germany, Tanzania and, of course, Denmark. The research covers four broad disciplines - linguistics, literature, social/historical/media studies, and international business communication - and regions in which English is the primary language - the British Isles, the United States and the English-speaking post-colonial world, as well as English as the global language of international business communication.. Research environment. The linguistic research ranges over language acquisition, multilingualism, comparative and theoretical phonetics and phonology, comparative and theoretical morphology and syntax, language variation and change, language comprehension, and how language is processed in the brain. Research in literature is concerned with a wide range of authors, from Shakespeare, through Austen and Dickens, to living writers such as Thomas Pynchon and Amitav Ghosh, as well as with theoretical approaches to literature such as new historicism, eco-criticism, gender studies, and the relations between literature and moral philosophy. Research in social/historical/media studies examines topics such as migration, hybridity and identity, culture and technology, ethnic conflict and nationalism, memory policy, cultural heritage and tourism, social media, film, and popular and folk music history. Research in international business communication ranges over theories and methods of strategic corporate communication, knowledge communication, lexicography, translation and intercultural communication needed to manage English professional communication in Danish and international companies and organisations with particular focus on business-related topics concerning the English language, business communication and the business environment..

Received 2022 November 18; Revised 2022 December 21; Accepted 2023 February 3.. See editorial "Strengthening Primary Health Care through Medical Education" in Volume 44 on page 181.. Abstract. Background. There is a shortage of general practitioners in Japan. With the revision of educational guidelines, general practice (GP) education has improved. However, the amount of education on GP in medical schools remains inconsistent. This study examined the relationship between medical students’ amount of GP-related education and their subsequent choice of GP majors.. Methods. A retrospective cohort study was conducted in a teaching hospital in Japan. Participants were residents in the hospital. The exposure comprised compulsory lectures and training time for community-based medicine in medical schools. The outcome included participants choosing GP majors after their initial 2-year junior residency.. Results. Fifty-one participants were included in the final analysis. Of these, 14 majored in GP and 37 in non-GP after their initial 2-year junior residency. Of the participants who took GP lectures for 18 hours or more, 11 chose GP majors, and 18 chose non-GP majors (risk ratio, 2.78; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.88–8.79). Of the participants who underwent training for 12 days or more, 10 chose GP majors, and 16 chose non-GP majors (risk ratio, 2.40; 95% CI, 0.87–6.68).. Conclusion. The results do not support the association between the amount of compulsory undergraduate education for community-based medicine and the subsequent increase in the number of residents choosing GP majors in Japan. Educators would do well to explore different approaches, such as improving the quality of education to increase the number of GP residents. Further research is needed to reach more definitive conclusions.. Keywords: General Practice; Career Choice; Undergraduate Medical Education; Community Medicine; Japan. INTRODUCTION. There is a need for more general practitioners in Japan. This shortage can be explained by the expanding demand in Japan’s aging society and insufficient supply [1]. Traditionally, general practice (GP) and family medicine (FM) remain unfamiliar in Japan. Instead, specialists frequently provide primary care [2]. Furthermore, board certification for FM or GP did not exist in Japan until the Japan Primary Care Association (JPCA) introduced board certification for FM in 2009. In 2018, a new board certification for GP by an independent third-party organization, the Japanese Medical Specialty Board, was launched [1]. Residents who finish a GP residency in this new system can take the JPCA’s FM certification exam as a subspecialty. As of 2022, there are 1126 JPCA-certified family physicians in Japan and no general practitioners from the new specialty system [3]. The number of new GP residents who began residency in 2022 was 250, comprising only 2.65% of the total [4].. Undergraduate education for GP in Japan has changed over the last 20 years. Japanese medical schools require the completion of a 6-year program. Residents who receive their medical license after graduation will start a 2-year junior residency and a subsequent residency program consisting of a specialty of their choice. Medical students receive an education based on the Model Core Curriculum published by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sport, Science, and Technology in 2000 and revised in 2007, 2010, and 2016 which serves	None	None	None	None	None		"<|im_sep|><Reasoning>
