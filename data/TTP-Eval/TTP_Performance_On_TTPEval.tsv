Posted By Francis On Wednesday, September 10, 2014 05:35 PM. Under General News, Lead Story. The Cuban Embassy in Ghana on Wednesday held a briefing to educate the media on the issues surrounding the arrest and incarceration of five Cuban nationals by the United States of America (USA).. The briefing was part of efforts by the Cuban Government to raise public awareness on the injustices relating to the issue and solicit for global support through a campaign to mount pressure on the US Government to revisit the case and free them.. Mr Jorge F. Lefebre Nicolas, Ambassador of Cuba, said the embassy would soon roll out activities for its annual campaign in Ghana to solicit for public support to call on the US Government to free the Cuban nationals currently serving varying jail terms in the USA.. The Cuban Five, also known as the Miami Five, include Gerardo Hernandez, Antonio Guerrero, Remon Labanino, Fernando Gonzalez, and Rene Gonzalez.. They are intelligence officers who were convicted in Miami of conspiracy to commit espionage, conspiracy to commit murder, acting as an agent of a foreign government to undertake other illegal activities in the USA.. Mr Nicolas said the five had been denied access to their families over the past 15 years and though two of them were released in October 2011 and February 2014 respectively, the campaign calling on the US to release the other three would be intensified to achieve the desired results.. The Ambassador explained that the five were in the United States to observe and infiltrate the US Southern Command and the Cuban-American groups, known as the Alpha 66, the F4 Commandos, the Cuban American National Foundation, and the Brothers to the Rescue.. He said although Cuba had contended that the men were sent to South Florida in the wake of several terrorist bombings in Havana which were masterminded by those anti-communists terrorists based in Miami, the US Government did nothing about it.. He said those terrorists groups had operated with complete impunity from the US to attack Cuba killing at least 3,478 Cubans and injuring about 2,099 over the past 40 years.. However, the five were able to infiltrate the terrorist organisations in Miami to inform Cuba of imminent attacks and to thwart their plots, “but instead of arresting the terrorists, the FBI arrested the Cuban Five who have been incarcerated over the past 15 years, serving various terms including life imprisonment.”. He said the campaign had received appreciable global support by institutions including the United Nations Commission on Human Rights which had adopted a report by its Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, calling on the US to remedy the situation; the Amnesty International, eight Nobel Prize winners as well as 110 members of the British Parliament.. The Ambassador appealed to Ghanaians to join in the crusade against world terrorism and the call for justice by the US by releasing the other three political prisoners and lifting the present blockade on Cuba.. He said the embassy would soon communicate to the media on a number of programmes and activities such as public lectures and a walk to create awareness and also marked the 16th year since the five were incarcerated..

Scam Shell Networks And Companies. List Of Scam Websites. Get Us Scammed!. Is shinwink.com A Scam? (Beware Of The BikendaTM Snow Removal Trap!). September 21, 2023 by Andy. Is shinwink.com a scam? Without a doubt, shinwink.com is a scam.. They audaciously claim to be selling the BikendaTM Electromagnetic Molecular Interference Antifreeze Snow Removal Instrument, boasting of NASA’s authoritative aerospace technology.. This product, they say, is your ultimate solution to effortlessly remove stubborn snow or ice from your vehicle.. But as the facade begins to crumble, the truth unravels.. Table of Contents. Toggle. 4 Undeniable Reasons That Make shinwink.com a Scam. Fed Up with Online Deceptions? Fight Back!. 4 Undeniable Reasons That Make shinwink.com a Scam. While navigating the vast online shopping realm, I stumbled upon many sites, and shinwink.com caught my attention for all the wrong reasons.. Let me share my findings:. 1. Eerily Identical To Another Scam Site. The layout, content, and overall vibe of shinwink.com eerily mirror that of the scam site warmfcare.com.. Both sites have strikingly similar designs, with identical navigation bars, product listings, and even customer testimonials.. What’s more concerning is their shared product, the BikendaTM Electromagnetic Molecular Interference Antifreeze Snow Removal Instrument.. This product, with its high-tech-sounding name and claims of NASA technology, is prominently featured on both sites.. The identical presentation and product descriptions raise a significant question:. Is shinwink.com merely a clone of another scam site?. This kind of replication is a common tactic among online fraudsters, aiming to cast a wider net to ensnare unsuspecting shoppers.. 2. A New Entrant in the Online World. A quick check on Whois.com reveals shinwink.com’s recent entry into the digital world.. Registered on May 18, 2023, its digital footprint is still fresh.. Now, what’s the catch?. Oftentimes, scam sites emerge rapidly, lure shoppers with enticing deals, and disappear without fulfilling promises.. That’s why shinwink.com’s recent registration raises immediate suspicions.. 3. Warnings from A Trusted Watchdog. Trusted online watchdogs serve as the first line of defense against potential scams, and shinwink.com has not gone unnoticed.. Scamwatcher.com, a reputable online sentinel, has flagged shinwink.com as a fraudulent site.. Specifically concerning the scam product BikendaTM Electromagnetic Molecular Interference Antifreeze Snow Removal Instrument.. But the concerns don’t end there. A deeper investigation reveals a pattern, with several other sites also promoting the same dubious product:. shopinature.com. warmfcare.com. natureicare.com. snowremovalinstrument.com. When multiple sites, especially those with questionable reputations, promote the same product with identical descriptions, it’s a clear indication of a coordinated scam operation.. 4. Copy-Paste Scheme. Originality and authenticity are the hallmarks of genuine e-commerce platforms.. However, shinwink.com’s content, especially the “About Us” section, raises eyebrows.. A closer examination reveals that this content isn’t unique to shinwink.com.. Several other sites have eerily identical “About Us” sections, pointing to a lack of originality and possible malicious intent. These sites include:. arotsukit.shop. jaysuing.com. monopure.net. koyswig.com. werioa.com. curefda.com. luckymogo.com. Such blatant content duplication is not just a sign of laziness; it’s a deliberate tactic employed by scam networks to quickly set up multiple sites.. Is shinwink.com a scam? Yes, and the evidence is compelling.. Beneath the polished exterior and tantalizing promises of groundbreaking products like the BikendaTM Electromagnetic Molecular Interference Antifreeze Snow Removal Instrument lies a web of deceit.. It’s easy to be dazzled by the shine of such innovations, but as the old adage goes: all that glitters isn’t gold.. In the digital age, where scams lurk around every corner, it’s more crucial than ever to be discerning.. Before parting with your hard-earned money, take a moment to dig deeper, trust your gut, and remember that genuine value is never built on shaky foundations.. Fed Up with Online Deceptions? Fight Back!. Ever been skeptical about a website but didn’t know how to verify its legitimacy? You’re not alone..

Published August 4, 2020 at 5:11 PM EDT. Facebook. Twitter. LinkedIn. Email. Jewel Samad / AFP via Getty Images. Some 1,892 American flags are installed on the National Mall in Washington, DC in 2014. The Iraq and Afghanistan veterans installed the flags to represent the 1,892 veterans and service members who committed suicide this year as part of the ""We've Got Your Back: IAVA's Campaign to Combat Suicide."". This summer the Trump administration rolled out the President's Roadmap to Empower Veterans and End a National Tragedy of Suicide (PREVENTS) - a long awaited strategy to bring down the rate of suicide in the military and among civilians. It focuses on enlisting community partners and a public awareness campaign to fight the stigma around seeking help during a mental health crisis.. Critics in congress have said the plan isn't proactive enough. But it does address one issue that has been seen as politically taboo: access to guns.. Suicide is notoriously difficult to study since it's a rare event, even as suicide rates for the military and civilians are on the rise. But if there's one obvious place to fight veterans' suicide, it's firearms. Gun owners are four times more likely to die by suicide. Veterans are almost twice as likely to be gun owners, and one study showed that one in three vets store their guns loaded and unlocked. Guns are by far the deadliest method of suicide.. But keeping guns away from veterans has been politically radioactive.. ""People really haven't wanted to touch the issue of firearms safety,"" said Terri Tanielian, a senior behavioral scientist at the RAND corporation.. She says the new White House roadmap was a bit disappointing - it took 15 months to endorse a set of recommendations that aren't very new.. But she is happy that the White House plan mentioned ""safe storage"" of guns. There had been rumors that the powerful gun-rights lobby would get that section removed from the plan.. ""Now that we're wading into that water, it is good to see that we are willing to talk about it and engage partners and do something meaningfully on this issue,"" Tanielian said..

Todd Callender). kamalaharris. richardpan. clinton. lizwarren. joebiden. soros. MISSING OATHS: Biden officials are impostors who swear no allegiance to the United States (feat. Todd Callender). 05/26/2023 / By Mike Adams. Today’s Brighteon Broadcast News features an interview with Lisa McGee and Todd Callender who reveal that numerous Biden officials — including AG Garland and so-called “Secretary of Defense” Lloyd Austin — have no legitimate oaths of office on file. This indicates they have no sworn allegiance to the United States of America and are merely “acting” as officials.. They are impostors, in other words. And legally speaking, their actions carry no legitimate authority. They are merely bluffing their way through office.. It turns out that much of the Biden regime has sworn no loyalty to the United States Constitution or its people. Instead, their loyalties lie outside the USA… with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) or globalists who wish to see the United States of America utterly destroyed.. This is why Mr. Austin, for example, is dedicated to the total destruction of the U.S. military. Only by destroying America’s ability to defend itself can the CCP invasion of America succeed. Right now, hundreds of thousands of military-aged males who belong to the CCP are crossing the undefended southern border, positioning themselves for an “activation day” at which time they will wage kinetic warfare against the people of America while destroying critical infrastructure such as refineries, power grid stations, bridges and military bases.. Mr. Mayorkas — another “official” with no proper sworn oath on file — is committing treason by allowing the CCP to invade the USA with military operatives who will take part in this kinetic war against this nation. Similarly, the ATF is actively seeking to disarm the American public by turning tens of millions of arm brace owners into felons through a flip-flop rule change that goes into effect in just a few days.. The takedown of America is a coordinated, treasonous, lawless affair that’s being run by corrupt criminals who aren’t even legitimate government officials. They are impostors working for an illegitimate regime that rigged the 2020 election and was never even voted into power by the American people.. Learn more in today’s bombshell interview with Lisa McGee and Todd Callender, as part of today’s Brighteon Broadcast News. Here’s what else we cover in this episode:. – Corporations that push LGBT agenda actually HATE YOU (but love Satan). – The North Face, run by left-wing morons, rolls out “real life homosexual” mascot. – Corporations commit brand suicide to appease the TRANS TYRANTS. – Target has lost $9 BILLION in valuation since pushing satanic trans gear for children. – People taking Ozempic weight loss drug sh#t their own bed sheets (and go BALD!). – NatWest bank INTERROGATES their own customers who dare to withdraw cash. – BLM has gone BROKE, burning through hundreds of millions of dollars in corporate donations. – REPARATIONS for all – end the Fed and stop the theft of spending power. – Full interview with Lisa McGee and Todd Callender. – Biden admin officials have NO OATHS of office on file – they are impostors!.

BY ASSOCIATED PRESS. CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) — Hundreds of students in graduation robes walked out of the Harvard commencement on Thursday chanting “Free, free Palestine” after weeks of protests on campus and a day after the school announced that 13 Harvard students who participated in a protest encampment would not be able to receive diplomas alongside their classmates.. Some students chanted “Let them walk, let them walk” during Thursday’s commencement, referring to allowing those 13 students to get their diplomas along with fellow graduates.. Student speaker Shruthi Kumar said “this semester our freedom of speech and our expressions of solidarity became punishable,” she said to cheers and applause.. She said she had to recognize “the 13 undergraduates in the class of 2024 who will not graduate today,” generating prolonged cheers and clapping from graduates. “I am deeply disappointed by the intolerance for freedom of speech and the right to civil disobedience on campus.”. Over 1,500 students had petitioned, and nearly 500 staff and faculty had spoken up, all over the sanctions, she said.. “This is about civil rights and upholding democratic principles,” she said. “The students had spoken. The faculty had spoken. Harvard do you hear us?”. Those in the encampment had called for a ceasefire in Gaza and for Harvard to divest from companies that support the war.. Commencement speaker Maria Ressa, a journalist and advocate for freedom of the press, told the graduates that “you don’t know who you are until you’re tested, until you fight for what you believe in. Because that defines who you are.”. “The campus protests are testing everyone in America. Protests are healthy. They shouldn’t be violent. They shouldn’t be silenced,” she said.. Asmer Asrar Safi was one of the 13 students blocked from receiving a diploma Thursday. The penalty shows how far the school will go to silence voices that challenge their donor base, he said.. “While we will not be returning to this school, we hope that our friends carry the liberatory legacy of the Gaza solidarity encampment alive, and strive even harder for divestment,” he said in a written statement.. Alaha Nasari, who graduated with a degree in the history of science and global health, said she and other students opted to walk out of the ceremonies when interim President Alan Garber took to the stage.. “I think that the lack of faculty support has been one of the most disheartening aspects of being a student protester,” she said.. Also on Thursday, the presidents of Northwestern and Rutgers universities defended their decisions to end pro-Palestinian encampments through negotiations rather than police force, telling the House Committee on Education and the Workforce that they defused the danger on their campuses without ceding ground to protesters. The hearing was part of a series examining how colleges have responded to allegations of antisemitism.. The decision by Harvard’s top governing board follows a recommendation Monday by faculty members to allow the 13 to receive their degrees despite their participation in the encampment.. However, Harvard’s governing board said that each of the 13 were found to have violated the university’s policies by their conduct during the encampment protest.. “In coming to this determination, we note that the express provisions of the Harvard College Student Handbook state that students who are not in good standing are not eligible for degrees,” the Harvard Corporation said in a written statement.. The statement left open the possibility of an appeals process.. Supporters of the students at Harvard said the decision not to allow them to receive degrees at commencement violated a May 14 agreement between Garber and the Harvard Out of Occupied Palestine coalition that would have allowed the students to graduate.. Protesters against the war between Israel and Hamas voluntarily dismantled	Topical					Hate/	"<|im_sep|><Reasoning>

https://communistvampires.blogspot.com/2017/	eng	"Communist Vampires: 2017. Communist Vampires. By Vampire Nation author Thomas M. Sipos, who blogs about horror films at Horror Film Aesthetics. So this blog will now be about. .. other stuff.. Sunday, October 15, 2017. Harvey Weinstein Raped Horror Actress Lysette Anthony. British actress Lysette Anthony has announced that she too was raped by producer Harvey Weinstein.. According to the Daily Mail [October 14, 2017]:. British actress Lysette Anthony has told police that Harvey Weinstein raped her, the Sunday Times reported, becoming the fifth woman to level such accusations against the disgraced Hollywood mogul.. The 54-year-old actress, who currently appears in British soap Hollyoaks, told Metropolitan Police last week that she had originally met Weinstein in New York, and agreed to meet him later at his rented house in London, according to the paper.. ""The next thing I knew he was half undressed and he grabbed me. It was the last thing I expected and I fled,"" she told the Times.. Anthony, who appeared in Woody Allen's 1992 film ""Husbands and Wives"", said that Weinstein then began stalking her, turning up unannounced at her house.. ""He pushed me inside and rammed me against the coat rack,"" she said of the attack in the 1980s. ""He was trying to kiss me and shove inside me. Finally I just gave up."". Weinstein has denied all allegations of nonconsensual sex.. Anthony first came to my attention when she played Angelique Bouchard in the short-lived 1991 Dark Shadows remake. While Anthony is not especially known as a scream queen, her extensive body of work (she has 89 acting credits on IMDB) does include many horror films and TV shows.. My favorite horror work by Anthony is Trilogy of Terror II (1996), in which she played the lead role in all three tales of that horror anthology sequel. This was in the tradition of Karen Black playing the lead in all three of the original Trilogy of Terror's stories.. The original is justly considered a horror classic and Black's performance was a tough act to follow. But while the remake is little remembered, Anthony's performance was a worthy successor to Black's. Especially in ""Bobby"" (the middle story), wherein Anthony plays a mother who turns to witchcraft in an attempt to resurrect her dead son. By all means, watch it.. Horror is a tight-knit community, composed of passionate fans. Although all of Weinstein's victims should be supported, reading about Anthony felt personal, as though ""one of our own"" was attacked. Let's hope Anthony and the other women find peace and justice.. =============. Posted by Thomas at 12:04 PM No comments:. Thursday, August 31, 2017. Remembering the Mass Hysteria Over Princess Diana's Death. Princess Diana died 20 years ago today in a car accident. Unless you were alive at the time, you can't imagine the mass hysteria that swept the British public over her death.. I never understood the adulation she attracted. She seemed rather ordinary to me. A pretty face, but lacking any great accomplishments other than marrying into the royal family at age 19. One of those celebrities who are famous simply for being famous.. It wasn't my imagination. Major newspapers today are recalling the mass hysteria. Jonathan Freedland writes in The Guardian:. It has become an embarrassing memory, like a mawkish, self-pitying teenage entry in a diary. We cringe to think of it. It is our collective moment of madness, a week when somehow we lost our grip. A decade on, we look back and wonder what came over us.. There were some who felt that way at the time, but they were the minority. Indeed, they complained they were a marginalised, even oppressed, group - gagged dissidents in a new totalitarian state of the emotions. Some looked at the mountain of Cellophane-wrapped bouquets that piled up outside Buckingham Palace - a million of them, it was said - and sniffed ""floral fascism"" in the air. Later, Christopher Hitchens wrote that in the week after Princess Diana was killed in a Paris car crash, Britain became a ""one-party state"", such was the coercive nature of the public reaction. He sought out the Britons who had been forced to close their shops or cancel sporting events on the day of the funeral, lest they feel the rage of the tear-stained hordes outside. The writer Carmen Callil was more specific: ""It was like the Nuremberg rallies."". Such was the crazy, cultish, worship of Princess Diana, that I wrote an essay at the time, entitled Deification of a Princess.. My predictions mostly failed to come true, apart from foreseeing the explosion in conspiracy theories. Many ""murder of Diana"" conspiracy books are available on Amazon. One book even attributes her ""murder"" to a plot involving both the CIA and MI6. But the Diana worship died down. It turned"			Topical			Sexual/	"<|im_sep|><Reasoning>

Share. I so often hear the peaceful protest that many athletes & private citizens are now doing during the “National Anthem” as “unpatriotic”, “anti-military”, and “unAmerican”. None of those things could be any further from the truth. By whatever standard you choose, be it James Baldwin, Martin Luther King Jr., or even the Rev. Al Sharpton, the truth in America is that all lives in this great country of ours is not treated the same. To deny that it is means either you are racist and don’t care, or are woefully ignorant and hiding your head in the sand. If we had an anthem that hailed Hitler, don’t you think sanctioning it at every sporting event would be anti-Semitic. I served in two different branches of the military, and if it is anything I fought for, it would be for the freedoms of all Americans, not just a select few. There is no mention in the Constitution where you have the privilege to tell another man, woman, or child who feels aggrieved how they should peacefully protest.. American flag. In general, I think black people love America more than anyone else because they’ve had to endure more than anyone to be fully recognized as a full citizen of this nation. I am sorry if that offends some, but sometimes the truth is painful. Al Sharpton once said that “the mirror is not just there to reflect what you see, but to correct what you see”. Right now, we are holding up a mirror and pointing out all our imperfections because we want to make this country better. But unlike that “make America great again” crowd, we want to make it great and fair for all people, black, white and everything in between. I sincerely understand that some of you may not fully comprehend or appreciate this message in its entirety right away, but I hope that you will refer to it from time to time, and carefully observe what is said and the actions of those around you on a daily basis.. I will continue to protest the NFL, it’s owners, and their sponsors until there is a recognition of the disparities that exist for people of color in all aspects of life. I will not fund my own oppression, and I encourage others not to do so either. There must be a significant effort to make life more equitable for all, not just something on paper or beautiful words spoken. You can say you love me all day long, but until your actions and deeds exemplify that — I’ll continue to fight for that day. My brother, Colin Kaepernick, is not, nor ever has he been ungrateful for the privileges his athleticism or upbringing has afforded him in life. However, as any mature man realizes, I do not live my life in isolation. Those that came before me, I owe a debt. It is because of the many countless lives lost and broken that we have the opportunities that stand before us today. Therefore it is incumbent upon us to reach back and help our fellow man, to use my platform to help uplift others. He did this (even knowing it) may be of significant self sacrifice.

Skip to content. News. World. Finance. Politics. Real Estate. Sports. Technology. Entertainment. Technology. Government spyware is another reason to use an ad blocker | TechCrunch. April 13, 2024 admin-dominor. Ad blockers might seem like an unlikely defense in the fight against spyware, but new reporting casts fresh light on how spyware makers are weaponizing online ads to allow governments to conduct surveillance.. Spyware makers are reportedly capable of locating and stealthily infecting specific targets with spyware using banner ads.. One of the startups that worked on an ad-based spyware infection system is Intellexa, a European company that develops the Predator spyware. Predator is able to access the full contents of a target’s phone in real time.. According to documents seen by Israeli news outlet Haaretz, Intellexa presented a proof-of-concept system in 2022 called Aladdin that enabled the planting of phone spyware through online ads. The documents included a demo of the Aladdin system with technical explanations on how the spyware infects its targets and examples of malicious ads: by “seemingly targeting graphic designers and activists with job offers, through which the spyware will be introduced to their device,” Haaretz reported.. It’s unclear if Aladdin was fully developed or was sold to government customers.. Another private Israeli company called Insanet succeeded in developing an ad-based infection system capable of locating an individual within an advertising network, Haaretz revealed last year.. Online ads help website owners, including this one, generate revenue. But online ad exchanges can be abused to push malicious code to a target’s device.. Delivering malware through malicious ads, often referred to as malvertising, works by injecting malicious code into the ads displayed on websites on computer and phone browsers. Much of these attacks rely on some interaction with the victim, such as tapping a link or opening a malicious file.. But the global ubiquity of online advertising vastly increases the reach that government customers have to target individuals — including their critics — with stealthy spyware.. While no phone or computer can ever be completely unhackable, ad blockers can be effective in stopping malvertising and ad-based malware before it ever hits the browser.. Ad blockers — as the name suggests — prevent ads from displaying in web browsers. Ad blockers don’t just hide the ads, but rather block the underlying website from loading the ads to begin with. That’s also good for privacy, since it means ad exchanges cannot use tracking code to see which sites users visit as they browse the web. Ad-blocking software is available for phones, as well.. Security experts have long advised using an ad blocker to prevent malvertising attacks. In 2022, the FBI said in a public service announcement to use an ad blocker as an online safety precaution.. “Everyone should block ads,” tweeted John Scott-Railton, a Citizen Lab senior researcher who has investigated government spyware, in response to the Haaretz report. “It’s a matter of safety.”.

South Korean Bitcoin Exchange Suffers $5 Million Hack, Issues Bitfinex-Like Tokens. Last Updated March 4, 2021 4:56 PM. Last Updated March 4, 2021 4:56 PM. By Joseph Young. Share on. Table of Contents. South Korean bitcoin exchange Yapizon was hacked earlier this week, losing more than US$5 million worth of user funds and bitcoin.. According to the exchange’s official statement translated by CCN.com, four hot wallets of the exchange were hacked by an unknown group of hackers. The Yapizon legal team noted that approximately 37 per cent of user funds were hacked and exactly 3,816 bitcoins were stolen from the exchange.. Users of Yapizon outraged over the exchange’s decision to spread losses from the theft equally amongst all bitcoin accounts. Considering that the exchange lost 37 per cent of its bitcoin reserves, the exchange announced its plans to deduct exactly 37 per cent of user balances.. Yapizon’s deduction of funds across all user accounts remains highly controversial, due to the difference in the financial status of Bitfinex. In August, Bitfinex lost $72 million worth of bitcoin after a major hacking attack. To recover the funds of their investors, the exchange issued Bitfinex tokens, which the company purchased overtime to compensate their traders. Ultimately, Bitfinex purchased all of the remaining Bitfinex tokens, effectively recovering the balances of every user affected by the hack.. The South Korean exchange is issuing a similar token to Bitfinex tokens called Fei, which would allow traders to reclaim their losses by obtaining company profits. According to the Yapizon management team, 1 per cent of Fei is equivalent to 1 per cent of Yapizon’s profit. Therefore, users will be able to recoup their funds as company profit in the long run.. However, the calculations of Yapizon’s Fei distribution is not clear. The exchange stated that users will be credited with one token of Fei per $78 of loss. Therefore, a user who has lost $100,000 from the hack would be credited with $1,282 Fei tokens.. Yapizon further noted that the company generates around $1.8 million of profit per year. Thus, users would have to wait over two years to have their funds recovered. This time period is substantially longer than that of Bitfinex, which completely recovered the balances of users within eight months that was significantly larger than that of Yapizon, by at last 14x.. “As seen in the security breach of Ethereum investment fund DAO that resulted in the loss of 3.6 million ETH and the hacking attack of Bitfinex which ultimately led to the loss of $70 million, Yapizon can certainly recover from the recent hacking attack. Yapizon entered the cryptocurrency industry four years ago and it is expanding services and operations rapidly across the region. From January to March of this year, Yapizon generated over $325,000 in profit and the company projects a total profit of $1.8 million by the end of 2017. If customers trust in Yapizon and its practices, the company believes it can make up for the losses of all customers relatively soon,” said the Yapizon team.. As of the now, the exchange remains closed to all users until further notice. The exchange stated that Fei tokens will be issued to users in the upcoming days.. Featured image from Shutterstock..

Twitter. Youtube. Pakistan’s government was accused of temporarily slowing down access to the internet on the same day the PTI (Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf) organized a massive online rally for their leader Imran Khan.. Several netizens expressed their frustration online at the slow speed of the internet. A statement on the PTI website further added, “The timing of the internet outage has raised eyebrows, occurring just before the PTI’s virtual assembly scheduled for 9:00 pm. Netblocks, an internet watchdog, highlighted this temporal correlation, leading to speculation about a potential connection between the outage and the political event.”. “It is absolutely despicable that in an era that boasts connectivity and open dialogue, we are witnessing a flagrant suppression of free speech and that too, on a national scale,” it said, adding that the move represents a clear infringement on the basic right to self-expression.. “The audacity of this blatant suppression is not just an affront to the citizens it seeks to control; it lays bare the regime’s utter incompetence in maintaining a resilient digital infrastructure,” the statement said.. Former Pakistani Prime Minister and cricketer was sentenced to three years of imprisonment on Aug. 5, 2023. The timing of the rally comes just a few months before Pakistan’s elections which will be held on Feb. 8 2024.. In a speech which garnered over 1.4 million views on Youtube and saw a live audience of tens of thousands on other social media forms, the revered leader said, “Our party is not allowed to hold public rallies,” as he urged supporters to show up in large numbers for the elections. “Our people are being kidnapped and their families are being harassed,” he stated.. Khan has also openly condemned the Israeli regime for its onslaught on Gaza which has now killed almost 20,000 people, mostly women and children. Imran Khan, who is currently behind bars in Pakistan, asked his lawyers to post his message of solidarity to the Palestinians from his official account.. “There is a genocide going on and it is utterly condemnable to see how the powerful are allowing it to happen with impunity. Israel is allowed to break all international laws as it commits war crimes and crimes against humanity in its massacre of the Palestinian people. The Muslim World must not just raise their voice against this but should also move to ensure an end to the #GazaGenocide. Our people will not forgive us if we do not stand on the side of Justice and Humanity,” he said in his post.. In an online video, Khan had also previously stated that Pakistan’s stance is the same stance of Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan and even mentioned that no one can change it.. Muhammad Al Jinnah was known to openly condemn the Israeli regime for he once famously stated that ‘’Israel is a dagger entered to the heart of the Ummah, this is an illegitimate state that Pakistan will never accept’.”.

The text reports on various incidents, including the suppression of a rally for former Pakistani leader Imran Khan, his solidarity with Palestine, and other related news. The text also mentions the Israeli regime's actions in Gaza, referring to it as a genocide and war crimes.

The text reports on incidents of violence and hate, such as the killing of people in Gaza and the suppression of free speech in Pakistan. This makes the Hate and Violence label ""Topical-i"" as it reports on hateful and violent incidents.

The text also discusses political bias and opinions against the Israeli regime and the Pakistani government. This makes the Ideological Harm label ""Topical-iii"" as it reports on political and cultural bias without promoting it.

There is no mention of any sexual content, illegal activities, or self-inflicted harm. Hence, their labels are ""None"".

Costo totale € 5 516 543,75. Contributo UE € 3 999 055,63. 3 999 055,63. 1 517 488,12. Coordinato da. TECHNIKON FORSCHUNGS- UND PLANUNGSGESELLSCHAFT MBH. Austria. Obiettivo. certMILS develops a security certification methodology for Cyber-physical systems (CPS). CPS are characterised by safety-critical nature, complexity, connectivity, and open technology. A common downside to CPS complexity and openness is a large attack surface and a high degree of dynamism that may lead to complex failures and irreparable physical damage. The legitimate fear of security or functional safety vulnerabilities in CPS results in arduous testing and certification processes. Once fielded, many CPS suffer from the motto: never change a running system.. certMILS increases the economic efficiency and European competitiveness of CPS development, while demonstrating the effectiveness of safety & security certification of composable systems.. The project employs a security-by-design concept originating from the avionics industry: Multiple Independent Levels of Security (MILS), which targets controlled information flow and resource usage amongst software applications. certMILS reduces certification complexity, promotes re-use, and enables secure updates to CPS throughout its life-cycle by providing certified separation of applications, i.e. if an application within a complex CPS fails or starts acting maliciously, other applications are unaffected.. Security certification of complex systems to medium-high assurance levels is not solved today. The existing monolithic approaches cannot cope with the complexity of modern CPS. certMILS uses ISO/IEC 15408 and IEC 62443 to develop and applies a compositional security certification methodology to complex composable safety-critical systems operating in constantly evolving hostile environments. certMILS core results are standardised in a protection profile.certMILS develops three composable industrial CPS pilots (smart grid, railway, subway), certifies security of critical re-useable components, and ensures security certification for the pilots by certification labs in three EU countries with involvement of the authorities..

The designs are engraved on the image plates and can be used over and over again - never wearing out!.. WHAT YOU'LL NEED:. Stamping Polish - For best results, we recommend you use our Lina Stamping Polishes or any other stamping polish brand. If you use a regular nail polish use one that is opaque and has a strong pigmentation. Avoid dry fast polishes.. Lina Stamper & Scraper (coming soon). You can use any plastic card you have as a scraper. Stamper is a MOST!. Lina Stamping Plates. Remove the transparent protective film before use.. BEFORE YOU START:. Make sure you remove the protective transparent plastic film from the front of the plates before use.. Clean the plate with a cotton ball with 100% pure acetone to remove the possible glue of the plastic film and let it dry. ONLY USE 100% ACETONE TO CLEAN THE PLATE.. HOW TO STAMP:. Make sure the base coat is completely dry before you stamp.. Apply a layer of the Stamp Stick Black on the selected design of the Lina Stamping Plate or any other stamping plate.. Use the scraper to remove the excess of polish, making sure you are holding it at a 45 ° angle. Do not press very hard in the process as this will cause too much of the polish to be scraped out of the engraving.. Roll the Stamper to pick up the polish from the design and transfer it onto your nail. Make sure to apply an even amount of pressure. For best results roll the stamp from one side of the other and use the same rolling motion when applying on the nail.. Apply 2 layers of our Fearless Top Coat or any other top coat for a smooth finish & done!. DIDN'T PICK UP?:. Clean and file the stamping head a bit or change the stamper you are using.. Clean the image with 100% pure acetone before applying nail polish.. After applying the polish in the image you need to WORK FAST to avoid the polish dries in the stamper and won’t transfer into your nail.. Try another type of polish. Some polishes dry too fast or are not opaque..

The text talks about adult films and actors from the 70s and 80s. It mentions various adult films, actors, and actresses, and provides ratings and reviews for these films. The text clearly falls under the category of sexual content as it discusses adult films and actors in detail.
The text does not have any educational sexual content, nor does it talk about sexual abuse or victims. It is purely focused on adult films and actors, which makes it fall under SE (c.i) as it displays sexual intent by involving porn, porn websites, and porn stars.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the opioid epidemic, and the recent vaping crisis, parents are uniting in Parent Movement 2.0 via the “I’m in” pledge, an instrument designed to create an online community intent on reducing the use of marijuana, alcohol, nicotine and other drugs among kids. These drugs can hurt and kill. “Because it attacks the lungs, COVID-19 could be an especially serious threat to those who smoke or vape tobacco and/or marijuana,” warns Nora Volkow, MD, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse.. Drugs are different from what today’s parents may have known when they were young, and how kids use drugs today is also changing. Via an email campaign, Parent Movement 2.0 helps today’s parents become more drug and alcohol savvy – providing ways to connect with other parents to get educated around issues of teenage substance use. Parents join Parent Movement 2.0 by reading and signing the “I’m in” Pledge, the same way parents joined the first parent movement.. Parent Movement 2.0 is patterned after the original parent movement that reduced illicit drug use among high school seniors by 66 percent – from 39 percent in 1979 to 14 percent in 1992. Sue Rusche and Carla Lowe, mothers who helped lead the effort in 1979 and who now lead National Families in Action (NFIA) and Americans Against Legalizing Marijuana (AALM), are helping launch the new movement.. Drug use up again. Since 1992, adolescent drug use has moved back up. Today, nearly one-fourth (22 percent) of 12th graders use marijuana, an 86 percent increase in marijuana use alone. Adolescent cigarette use is virtually nil, but vaping nicotine has skyrocketed, and alcohol continues to be the national drug of choice among 12th graders, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) study, Monitoring the Future.. “Parents need to get up to date. Rivaled only by their children’s peers, parents have the greatest influence over a child’s decision to use any drug,” says Debbie Berndt, director of the new movement. “Not every parent will be successful in helping their kids choose not to use, but every parent certainly is the first line of defense, and they become the first responders if their child begins to use.”. Take the “I’m in” Pledge. Surgeon General VADM Jerome Adams warned in August that no amount of marijuana is safe during adolescence or during pregnancy. He added that recent increases in both marijuana potency and in access to the drug, along with misperceptions about the safety of marijuana, endanger children and youth, the country’s most precious resources.. “We’re excited that through Parent Movement 2.0 and the “I’m in” Pledge, parents now have a process to get quickly educated, to understand the drugs their kids face every day, and to learn how to take action to protect them,” says Carla Lowe, President of AALM.. Addiction industries target youth. The well-funded marijuana, alcohol, and nicotine industries are driving the narrative in our country through lobbyists, PR firms, and an increasing number of current and past legislators on payroll. Parents have a difficult time sorting through what might be true or not. Kids, who are the target audience for many industry marketing dollars, become unwitting industry mouthpieces, especially with their parents. Parents frequently hear from their kids, “vaping is safe; it’s no big deal mom” and “marijuana is safer for me than alcohol.” On no scale of measurement are these claims true.. “Parents get duped by the narrative and the same incessant media beat that we all do,” says Sue Rusche, president and CEO of NFIA. “The increasingly permissive national narrative on drug use, legalization, and medical claims that have not been vetted by the FDA drive drug ‘normalization’ at the cost of our kid’s mental health and well-being. We know so much today, more than even ten years ago, about adolescent neuroscience, as well as how drugs can change the function and structure of the brain, especially kids’ brains.”. Few parents today are aware of this new knowledge, which compounds this normalizing affect.. “It’s time for parents to re-engage,” says Ms. Berndt. “We invite them ‘all in’ to Parent Movement 2.0.”. Parents can read and sign the “I’m in” Pledge to become part of the new Parent Movement here.. Share on Facebook. Tweet.

The text talks about a movement called ""Parent Movement 2.0"" which aims to reduce the use of marijuana, alcohol, nicotine, and other drugs among kids. The text provides information about the movement, its goals, and how parents can join the movement by signing the ""I'm in"" pledge. It also provides statistics and warnings about the dangers of drug use among adolescents.

The text does not contain any Hate or Violence, Ideological Harm, Sexual content, or Illegal content. It does, however, talk about the dangers of drug use and aims to raise awareness and prevent drug use among kids, which falls under Self-Inflicted content. Since the text is raising awareness and providing prevention methods, it falls under ""Topical-iii"" for Self-Inflicted content.

Terms and Conditions. Kodak Black Responds to SteveWillDoIt Over Alleged Richard Mille Theft. By Sophie / June 17, 2024. News. Kodak Black Responds to SteveWillDoIt Over Alleged Richard Mille Theft. Kodak Black has found himself in the middle of a heated controversy with YouTuber SteveWillDoIt, following accusations of an attempted theft involving a $500,000 Richard Mille watch. The drama unfolded when SteveWillDoIt took to Twitter, now rebranded as X, to claim that the rapper tried to rob him.. In a series of now-deleted tweets, SteveWillDoIt questioned the financial status of rappers, stating, “Do rappers make money? Kodak Black just tried to rob me for my Richard Mille. Is every rapper broke? The guy smokes meth, probably insane. Kodak Black is 100% on drugs.”. Kodak Black, visibly upset, responded during an Instagram Live session. “That’s why I hate drunk stuff. I hate drunk stuff. People always get beside themselves. That’s why I don’t drink liquor no more,” he said. Addressing SteveWillDoIt directly, Kodak added, “Why are you being prejudiced, sir? Have you seen me do any drugs? You made a tweet to the whole world like I wasn’t finna get on the internet and say, ‘Oh, SteveWillDoIt is a b****.’ I told you to your face and I threw your stuff on the floor.”. The incident, which reportedly occurred without any additional witnesses, remains shrouded in uncertainty. However, Kodak Black appears to be taking the accusations seriously enough to threaten SteveWillDoIt with physical harm. “I don’t give a [expletive] about none of them muscles or that tight ass suit you was wearing yesterday,” Kodak fired back. “I told you to your [expletive] face. A n**** will knock your drunk ass out.”. The back-and-forth has drawn significant attention online, with fans and followers weighing in on the dispute. While some support SteveWillDoIt’s version of events, others find it implausible that Kodak, who reportedly owns multiple high-end watches, would attempt such a theft.. This feud comes on the heels of Kodak Black’s recent collaboration with Don Toliver for their new single, “BROTHER STONE.” The two artists shared a music video for the song on Saturday afternoon, adding another layer of complexity to Kodak’s current public image.. As the situation continues to unfold, it remains to be seen whether the two will resolve their differences or if the feud will escalate further. For now, the online community remains divided, with both Kodak Black and SteveWillDoIt standing firm in their respective positions.. Related Posts.

http://candycritic.org/bulls%20balls.htm	eng	Bull's Balls. Bull's Balls. Rudei Dudes. I really wish that I had something interesting to say about this candy. Sure, you’ll get a chuckle (depending on your sense of humour) over the name “Bull’s Balls”. The thing is, I’m not sure you’ll get much more joy from this candy after that. The only thing that continues the joke a little bit is the fact that the gumball is slightly elongated and coloured brown. You might say that the red goo in the middle might be “fun”, or themed to this treat, only it really doesn’t ooze that much. If you wanted to simulate someone eating a raw bull testicle, it might be a good idea to use really oozy red filling instead of something that feels more like a gummy than an ooze. I guess what I’m saying is, if you want to get a chuckle over this candy, it might be best to take a picture if you see it at a candy store, or just share this review with your friends. Chances are, if you buy it, after you open the package, the joke will be over.. The gum is one of the blander gums I’ve had in a while. It’s not that it’s tasteless really, it’s just not that exciting. It claims to be “tutti fruitti & raspberry flavoured”, but all I tasted was your standard plain bubble gum flavour. There might have been a slight hint of berry or something in the gel in the middle, but it was quickly overtaken by the plain bubble gum flavour. Figuring out the flavours of this gum was only made harder due to the fact that the flavour lasts about one minute, and has a very rapid decline. After chewing for about 5 minutes I could barely taste anything at all.. I can’t say that I was expecting much out of this gumball, and that’s pretty much what I got. I’ll continue to try and dig through these oddly themed candies, in hopes that one day I’ll come across a surprisingly good one. At this point I can’t recommend that you buy a Bull’s Balls candy, just enjoy the chuckle you get at your local candy store, and move along to something a bit tastier like some Jelly Bellies or Gummy Bears.. .

Hey guys.. I've just been playing the new bloodbowl PC game and loved it. What I was wondering was how many of the club members have this game, or are going to get it (pc version).. Do we have enough to start a league for the club.. Cheers,. Shags. Shags. cleverfellow. Global Moderator. Posts: 376. How many club members have bloodbowl pc Jul 30, 2009 20:14:35 GMT 10. Quote.

I will most likely pick the game up later this year - there's a few miniatures I would like to buy first, then I'll grab a copy.. Online turn-based league sounds good to me.. bensmall. Gamer.

Post by bensmall on Aug 12, 2009 13:36:08 GMT 10. I'm definitely interested in this, but we can already do this for free with the site:. www.fumbbl.com. The only problem with it is its on LRB4 rules, but I'd prefer that with more of us in, than only 3 of us buying the PC game. Is the PC game on LRB5 rules? How much does it cost?. cleverfellow.

I honestly don't know what the ruleset is, but the game is USD49, so the actual cost fluctuates with the exchange rate... you can't buy it in stores at the moment.. shags. Global Moderator.

I prefer fumbbl with all the races, but I'd be keen to play this version if people happy to play over hamachi.. Last Edit: Oct 13, 2009 7:50:01 GMT 10 by shags. Reply.
