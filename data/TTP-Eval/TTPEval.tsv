As I sat on the bench close to my sister, I could hear Ngozi scream. Her voice almost pierced the sky. My mother was also crying with her. It was as if she was the one who was being cut and not her innocent three-month-old baby. Nneka, too, was scared. She clung to me tight while I covered her ears with both hands. I didn't mind my ears getting bled from the woes of that day; I guess my sister needed hers more than I did.. Throughout that day, my mother sat close to the baby, crying. She was looking at our baby sister and raining all kinds of insult on my father's extended family.. ""This is our tradition, Nnenna. You know that very well,"" my father said, in a way trying to pacify my mother.. ""This is wickedness! No girl should go through this! No girl!"" My mother sounded defiant.. ""Ogini? What about boys? Don't they get circumcised, too?"" he fired back.. That woke up Ngozi who resumed her sobbing. My mother picked her up, placed her on her chest and began to dance to a silent rhythm.. ""Ozugo!"" was what my father said that made our baby come to a decrescendo. Maybe Ngozi understood Igbo, or she needed to give our parents space to discuss.. ""Look at our poor baby. And I begged you, Okafor. I told you it wasn't necessary, but you allowed those wicked people cut my baby. Our baby!"" my mother teared up. She began to sob heavily, cleaning her snot with the edge of her wrapper.. ""Nnenna, why are you doing like this nau? You, of all people, know it is what tradition demands. There was nothing I could have done. It is what our forefathers have been doing. We can't change it."" He paused, then continued, ""Our elders say that 'what the old men can see while seating, the young ones cannot see it even if they climb a tree.' To you, it might look like a terrible thing; but to us, it is the right thing. The best thing we can do to help protect our girls. We don't want them to be promiscuous. Look at Ezinne, Chidi's daughter. She is prostituting herself upandan because she was never circumcised. Tell me, will a circumcised girl do like that?"" He expected my mother to answer, but she hissed in disgust. My father didn't mind her, but carried on with his sermon.. ""Look at Adaobi,"" he pointed at me. ""Isn't she a good girl? Very decent girl. Pure virgin!"" he said 'girl' like 'gal' and 'virgin' like 'varjeen.' ""Since she got circumcised, she has kept herself, not allowing any man to touch her. She's saving herself for marriage. You should be grateful that our daughter, at sixteen, is still keeping her legs closed. So many girls, that are not even up to her age, have already been disvarjeend! I know my daughter will make me proud,"" he said complacently, grinning from ear to ear.. Only if my father knew how Okeke, my older cousin, always sneaked into our compound most nights to put his thing into mine, savouring me with so much pleasure. Painful pleasure. Okeke said it would help me to become a big girl, and that I would enjoy sex better when I got married.. WHAT TRADITION DEMANDS. Readersketch | Ed. Kawthar A. Omisore. ¬© Bianca Ihua.

We‚Äôre a New York-based startup with a revolutionary mission: we're bringing transparency to the health-care marketplace by telling people what stuff costs.. Shouldn‚Äôt you know that a simple MRI could cost as little as $400 or as much as $2,300 in the New York area? Or that a lab test billed at several hundred dollars can actually be gotten for as little as $15?. Health-care costs are rising. We think it‚Äôs important that people know such things. Especially since more of us are paying cash for medical care every day‚Äîeither because we‚Äôre on high-deductible insurance plans, or we‚Äôre out of network, or we‚Äôre uninsured.. Jeanne Pinder, our founder, is a longtime journalist; she volunteered for a buyout from The New York Times in late 2009 to reinvent herself. She has won several grants to found clearhealthcosts.com, most recently from the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, which is funding a project for clearhealthcosts to crowdsource health-care prices in California with KQED public radio in San Francisco and KPCC/Southern California Public Radio in Los Angeles..

Games Might Cost You A Kings Ransom. Read more about the. Las Vegas 2024 Super. Bowl Streaker!. Other than the obvious fact that a few online casinos (an estimated thirty percent) will never pay their customers one copper penny either because you might never succeed or they just don't to pay out if you do, there are a few ""poor wagers"" regardless of where you wager. This article looks at some of the games that will cost you an arm and a leg if you do not alter your gambling ways.. One of the atrocious wagers is a parlay wager in sports betting. This is where a bunch of wagers are put one after the other and while some parlays might be good investments. Above all parlays are the ""bonehead"" wagers that the bookies are fond of because you, as a gambler, will be beat more often than you will succeed.. Net keno is a awful bet in the bricks and mortar casinos and equally so on the internet. If you prefer the numbers, bet on bingo instead of keno. It may look like a successful proposition but it is designed to lure you in that way so please refuse the appeal.. The second bets that poker sites have added are ample to cause you to bust a gut. First, you almost do not notice them and after that when you do, you spend the next few minutes in an attempt to decode the concept. Here it is in a nutshell - it is simple to decode, but do not bother, it's a really bad wager!. Net roulette ranks up there as a member of the poorest of all casino bets. If you scrutinize a few assessments of from a few years back, you will realize this hasn't always been the way. Be sure to continually keep a look out for advancements, but at the current time web roulette is to be prevented at all costs in just about all web gaming rooms.. Filed under: Casino Leave a comment.

(CNN Espa√±ol) ‚Äî El pleno de la Asamblea Nacional de Ecuador rechaz√≥ este viernes la solicitud enviada por la Corte‚Ä¶. Listen now to WTOP News WTOP.com | Alexa | Google Home | WTOP App | 103.5 FM. (CNN Espa√±ol) ‚Äî El pleno de la Asamblea Nacional de Ecuador rechaz√≥ este viernes la solicitud enviada por la Corte Nacional de Justicia que ped√≠a autorizar el procesamiento penal de la vicepresidenta de la Rep√∫blica, Ver√≥nica Abad, por su presunta participaci√≥n en el delito de concusi√≥n.. No hubo los 92 votos necesarios para que el parlamento diera luz verde al enjuiciamiento penal, requerimiento legal necesario para los dignatarios ecuatorianos que gozan de fuero de Corte.. Durante la sesi√≥n convocada la tarde de este viernes, la Asamblea aprob√≥ por mayor√≠a una moci√≥n de la asamble√≠sta Gissella Molina √Ålvarez para que se rechazara la petici√≥n judicial. La moci√≥n se aprob√≥ con 75 votos a favor, 38 en contra y 20 abstenciones.. Estos son los escenarios si la Asamblea Nacional de Ecuador autoriza proceso penal por posible concusi√≥n contra la vicepresidenta Abad. Esta decisi√≥n frena la solicitud de la jueza Daniela Camacho, de la Corte Nacional de Justicia, para que la Asamblea permitiera el enjuiciamiento de la vicepresidenta Abad, quien ha rechazado los se√±alamientos en su contra.. La Fiscal√≠a busca procesar a Abad por presuntas irregularidades. En principio, le atribuy√≥ el delito de tr√°fico de influencias, pero recientemente inform√≥ que reformular√° los cargos por concusi√≥n, que el C√≥digo Penal define cuando un servidor p√∫blico o un particular con potestad estatal abusa de su cargo ordenando o exigiendo la entrega de derechos, cuotas, contribuciones o gratificaciones.. Antes de la sesi√≥n de este viernes, CNN solicit√≥ comentarios al equipo de Abad y est√° en espera de respuesta. La vicepresidenta mantiene una abierta y p√∫blica confrontaci√≥n con el presidente Daniel Noboa desde la campa√±a electoral. Ambos iniciaron funciones el 23 de noviembre pasado. Noboa se resiste a encargarle la Presidencia durante la campa√±a presidencial, pues Noboa prev√© postularse a la reelecci√≥n en 2025..

Code for Construction Product Information and guidance published. Oct 26, 2021 | Building Safety Act. The Code for Construction Product Information (CCPI), Code guidance and a manufacturer information pack have been launched today to drive higher standards in the presentation of construction product information in the manufacturing industry.. The Code has been developed as a direct response to Dame Judith Hackitt‚Äôs independent review of Building Regulations and Fire Safety in the wake of the Grenfell Tower disaster. The Code promotes urgent positive culture and behaviour change in the approach and management of product information by the construction product manufacturing industry.. The Code offers manufacturers the opportunity to demonstrate a progressive approach through their willingness to provide assurance for their product information, and recognition for their efforts to prioritise product safety.. It aims to ensure that disingenuous marketing practices and the provision of misleading product information becomes a thing of the past, so that those using products in the construction and maintenance of buildings ‚Äì including specifiers, architects, consultants and contractors, as well as the ultimate end users of the building ‚Äì can trust the information provided by manufacturers when making design decisions, installing and using and maintaining verified products.. A robust eleven point code published. The Code ‚Äì developed by the Construction Products Association‚Äôs Marketing Integrity Group following industry-wide consultation ‚Äì has been built on the principle that product information must be Clear, Accurate, Up-to-date, Accessible and Unambiguous. The Code has eleven clauses covering critical aspects from responsibility for product information to transparency of information regarding performance, proof of stated claims and general information and competency.. An independent and robust validation process is being put in place to underpin the Code that will rebuild trust in the provision and management of product information by all stakeholders, setting the market for UK construction products ahead of others.. Support for manufacturers preparing for the verification process. Alongside Code guidance, a ‚ÄòPreparing for the Code‚Äô information pack has been published today to help manufacturers gain an understanding of the Code and prepare for the verification journey.. Registration for verification will open towards the end of 2021, supported by detailed guidance. Organisations can register their interest now to receive updates ahead of the launch of verification.. Independently managed Code and verification. Management of the published Code and its verification has been formally handed over from the Construction Products Association to Construction Product Information Ltd (CPI Ltd) ‚Äì a not-for-profit organisation with independent governance and management being set-up to administer the CCPI by the Considerate Constructors Scheme.. Amanda Long, Chief Executive of the Considerate Constructors Scheme and Construction Product Information Ltd, said:. ‚ÄúThe Code should be a priority for all involved with construction product manufacturing. By focusing on culture, leadership and ethics the Code for Construction Product Information will build trust and is a progressive step towards ensuring that building safety is a priority for those responsible for the provision of construction product information.‚Äù. Enabling responsible manufacturers to assure their product information and be recognised for their efforts, the Code will support urgent and positive culture and behaviour change in the industry ahead of regulation.‚Äù.

Overall Customer Service : Good. Review Description. They picked up the car on Friday with only a few problems. They told me they'd be there around 10-11 am so my fiance stayed home from work to be there and they didn't show up until almost 2 pm so that was a little annoying but definitely understandable given the people we were dealing with (non-educated and incredibly rude). Where my frustration came in was on Saturday. I got a call around 2:45 pm CST from a guy who could barely speak English. He said he would be in Branford, CT Sunday morning by 10 am. I clarified with him that it was the following Sunday (9/30) like you and I agreed. He said no, it was yesterday (9/23). I immediately started to get upset knowing that you told me to stop worrying and you guys do this all the time and that was far from what was happening. Every concern I had was now coming to fruition. I told the driver (or attempted to with his broken English) that we would not be there and he'd have to wait until next Sunday (9/30) to deliver. He hung up on me and then about an hour later I get a call from his dispatcher. He tells me that if they cannot deliver by 11 am, that he will bring the car to Springfield, MA and we'd have to pick it up there. Where our house is is a good 2 hour drive to Springfield! Trying to be polite, I was getting irate that I was the one being inconvenienced for something that wasn't my fault. To make a long story short, he told me to call someone in the area and have them get the car. I said that isn't my responsibility as I paid for a service that they were not coming through on. So here I was calling my Mom asking for her to help get $500 cash and to have the guy deliver the car to her on Sunday. To no shock, she didn't have $500 cash on her and now that it was almost 5 pm EST on a Saturday, every bank was closed and wouldn't be open until Monday. So she had to call my Dad (her ex) to ask for his help as well. Your company/broker company put me in a VERY difficult spot and an extremely awkward one. After I called the dispatcher back, he said that if the car wasn't delivered by 12 noon, he was bringing it to Springfield, MA. I asked him to please work with me as I was already going out of my way to work with him when I should've had no obligations to. My Mom had plans until 4 pm and wouldn't be around to accept the car until then. He finally worked with me after a 3rd phone call to him and the car was delivered yesterday. I do not know of any body damage issues but I won't be able to check that out until we arrive this Saturday, 9/29. The delivery guy was a complete jerk to my Dad yesterday and demanded that my Dad drive him back to his truck after he was a jerk dropping off the money. Just simply an awful experience all thanks to the companies that State 2 State brokers with. I just want others to know that when JP at State 2 State says not to worry and he does this all the time, you still have every right to worry.. Reply or submit a rebuttal for	Intent					Hate/

Councils are warning of a new coronavirus-related scam which sees criminals calling or texting individuals and offering a coronavirus vaccination at a cost.. In May 2020, the Local Government Association, which represents councils across England and Wales, warned that some councils had already recorded a 40% increase in reported scams since the pandemic first began.. Council trading standards teams are now receiving reports of scammers calling to offer an appointment to receive a vaccine at a cost or sending a text that directs the recipient to a convincing fake NHS website with a booking link.. The LGA said the COVID-19 vaccine will always be free in the UK and delivered by the NHS.. Patients will be sent a letter by the NHS call/recall service informing them of their eligibility, and receive a call from Primary Care Networks, offering the choice of booking at a GP-led vaccination centre or using the national booking service.. The LGA is urging people who are contacted to remember that any contact regarding a real NHS COVID-19 vaccination booking will never:. Ask for payment or any bank details. Ask you to press a button on your keypad when on the phone. Ask you to send a text to confirm the booking. Anyone who has concerns about whether an approach is genuine should speak to their local GP surgery.. Cllr Nesil Caliskan, chair of the LGA‚Äôs Safer and Stronger Communities Board, said: ‚ÄòWith the UK scaling up its COVID-19 vaccinations across the country, ruthless and opportunistic scammers will be looking to take advantage of the rollout.. ‚ÄòEveryone must remain vigilant to these scams and tell family and friends what to look out for to help avoid them being scammed.. ‚ÄòThe NHS will never charge for a coronavirus vaccine, so anyone claiming to offer you a booking over the phone or online who asks for payment or bank details is attempting to scam you.. ‚ÄòWhen you are contacted about your legitimate vaccine, you will be offered to book through your GP or the national booking service, and if you aren‚Äôt sure about the call‚Äôs validity, call your GP who will be able to confirm this to you.. ‚ÄòThe rollout of the vaccine provides reason to be optimistic and it can be exciting to receive a text or call about it, but we must make sure we don‚Äôt get complacent when it comes to scams.‚Äô.

White Ted Nugent on black Obama's speech. Posted bykkkaraoke February 14, 2013 Leave a comment on White Ted Nugent on black Obama's speech. White Ted Nugent, shock rocker, at Obama‚Äôs message yesterday. I never have watched a State of Union message, and even though I could get on computer, decided that I don‚Äôt even want to listen to Obama even to get angry or watch him. It is not for White women to ‚ÄúIdolize‚Äù black or Jew or other men. Yellow Chinese Communist women who don‚Äôt even have God have respect and show complete preference for yellow men. They don‚Äôt care if they are poor as long as they are ‚Äúgood‚Äù and have ‚Äúcharacter.‚Äù Sometimes I wonder which people us or them that are closer to God‚Äôs idea of the universe. Here‚Äôs from Ted Nugent. He blocked out most of the speech probably, but I give him credit for using his rock muscle to take a stand.. ‚ÄúMy favorite part was when I couldn‚Äôt hear clearly,‚Äù said Mr. Nugent to reporters after the address. ‚ÄúThen, I didn‚Äôt get angry.‚Äù. I‚Äôm just wondering what the ‚Äúwhite‚Äù statue behind him is all about. It seems as if something is broken or open. Also, there is another white statue behind that one. I‚Äôm sure the TV news ‚Äúplanned‚Äù where they were going to film him, that is why I wonder what the ‚Äúbackground‚Äù white statues were all about. It‚Äôs called ‚ÄúWhite History‚Äù 101 and if our Jew schools won‚Äôt teach us our White history we need to ‚Äúblock‚Äù out the other histories, including black history, or Jew holocaust or Wiki that has us worship Jews, but find out our own history and ‚Äúre-write‚Äù it in truth.. http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=50140946n.

Jane Doe March 18, 2016 Short StoriesStories. Ten resounding slaps and a hundred another bruises later, she somehow gathered herself together and got up. The cuts in her thighs pained. She endured this every day of her life, but what other option did Rashmi have? Love Jihad was in news and that had given her the motivation to elope with her boyfriend from college. He promised to take care of her and love her unconditionally. She was naive and believed him. Religion posed as a barrier in their love story.. Complications of Love Jihad. Rashmi hailed from a lower middle class family in Aligarh. While Wasim was an orphan who had learnt life the hard way. Within six months of falling in love with each other they decided to get married. Ofcourse Rashmi‚Äôs parents objected to the choice and like all love stories, this couple also decided to elope and get married.. One dawn she packed her bare essentials and fled to Lucknow alongwith Wasim. They got married and soon Allah gifted them with Jamal and Javed. All was going fine until Wasim got addicted to alcohol. In a span of three weeks the house was empty from all its pittance savings and what followed soon was the first taste of domestic violence.. Episodes of torture lead to something courageous. Rashmi sat down to roll chapattis. Javed was crying. Wasim was out to get drunk with his friends. She didn‚Äôt have the energy to get up and deal with her crying son. She looked at the huge bruise on her left hand. It was bleeding. Something inside her stirred that day. The sight of her own blood was a common sight for her these days. But those two tiny droplets made her realise that she didn‚Äôt have to endure an abusive husband and an inhuman life.. Image Source. She got up opened a oddly stored bag and took out a mangalsutra which she had bought but never worn. Rashmi kept it hidden and a secret hoping some day Wasim would adopt to her Hindu past and let her wear the mangalsutra. But the day had never come. Love Jihad didn‚Äôt really help her much. Rushing through the quick memories of past she was brought back to present and a sense of courage set in to change the situation.. Love Jihad had to die.. will it?. The new found bravery gave her the confidence that she could escape. She took each step with great determination and opened the latch of the main door , however just then the twins started crying again. Those wails were the only thing that could stop her footsteps towards embracing freedom. That was the hardest decision in her life, harder than running away from her parents.. She could see Jamal tilting his head. No, she couldn‚Äôt trust her monstrous husband to take care of them. She had to be there for them or come back for them. They were the reason for her existence.. Just then Wasim returned with a bottle of local ethyl in his hand.. ‚ÄúWhere are you going? Why is the bloody door open?‚Äù. ‚ÄúI was‚Ä¶ I was just looking‚Ä¶‚Äù. Before she could complete a loud smack plonked her onto the floor and she became a slave to the barbarian all over again.. Also Read. Love Hate Relationship With Mughals.

Additional guidance. Regional exceptions to the standard NHLA grades. The NHLA grades cover the majority of commercial hardwood species growing in the USA. The following is a brief summary of the various species and colour sorting that can be ordered from the American supplier.. Red alder. Grows exclusively in the Pacific Northwest between the vast stands of softwood timber such as Douglas fir and pine and is the most important commercial hardwood in this region. The grading rules for red alder are geared more for specific end uses and appearance. Alder is graded using NHLA 'Pacific Coast Red Alder Rules published in the ‚ÄúNHLA Rules for the Measurement & Inspection of Hardwood and Cypress‚Äù. The rules were developed on the West Coast of the USA with those manufacturers and exports in mind.. The key grading points include grading from the better face rather than poor side as in the Standard NHLA Grading Rules; pin knots are regarded as character and no defect. The primary grades include Superior (Select & Better), Cabinet (No. 1 Common) and Frame (No 2. Common) which are similar to the uses as for the standard NHLA grades.. An exceptional cabinet wood typically sold surfaced (planed) and often cut to specific lengths and widths. Consult with your local supplier for a more detailed explanation of the alder grades and products available.. Walnut. Considered the elite of the American hardwoods, walnut is the favourite of the darker woods for fine furniture, interiors and gunstocks. Walnut grows in widely scattered stands throughout the eastern half of the United States, primarily in the Midwest. Historically, the grading rules for FAS walnut have been refined to encourage better use of this valuable species. Because of this, FAS walnut grades allow for smaller boards, both in width and length. Natural characteristics are also admitted to a greater extent than the standard NHLA grade rules for other species. A detailed explanation can be found in the NHLA rules book. Consult with your local supplier for the walnut grades and products available.. Go back to Grading Sawn Lumber section. Colour sorting. In addition to sorting for grades or selecting specific widths, various species are commercially sold at an added value when colour is also considered. It is important to note, colour in this explanation refers to sapwood and heartwood.. Number 1 and 2 white. A colour selection typically made on hard maple, but can be applied to any species where sapwood clear cuttings are desired, such as ash, birch, and soft maple.. Number 1 white means both faces and edges of the clear cuttings must be all sapwood.. Number 2 white means that one face and both edges of the clear cuttings must be sapwood and not less than 50% sapwood on the reverse face.. Sap and Better. Commercially sold when only one face of the board needs to be sapwood. Usually applied to the same species as Number 1 and 2 White, although just a little less stringent. In Sap and Better every board should have a minimum of one sapwood face in the clear cuttings.. Red one

Gemma O‚ÄôDoherty is a multi award-winning journalist whose work has shone a light on some of the darkest corners of Irish life. Former Chief Features writer at the Irish Independent, where she worked for almost 20 years, she has exposed many cases of murder and child sexual abuse that have been covered up by An Garda Siochana and the State. A Masters‚Äô graduate from UCD, she was the first journalist to support the work of Garda whistleblowers Maurice McCabe and John Wilson and revealed how former Garda Commissioner Martin Callinan had abused road safety laws for his own personal gain. Her two-year investigation into the cover-up of Fr Niall Molloy‚Äôs brutal murder led to a state inquiry. When Denis O‚ÄôBrien ‚Äì the Clinton‚Äôs biggest Irish donor ‚Äì became the owner of INM, she was ordered to give up her anti-corruption work or leave her job. She successfully sued INM and went onto become a film producer. Her documentary ‚ÄòMary Boyle: The Untold Story‚Äô has been viewed more than 1 million times and won several international awards. The film about Ireland‚Äôs longest and youngest missing person revealed how a politician had ordered the police to shield the political suspect whom they believed had raped and murdered the child..

It's been revealed that Deepika will play 'a razor-sharp huntress' in the film. Images Staff. 22 Jan, 2016. After bagging the Filmfare Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role (Female), Deepika is now looking to begin a new chapter in her career with her first Hollywood film, i.e., Vin Diesel's XXX: The Return of Xander Cage.. In the film, Deepika will play a a razor-sharp huntress who helps Cage during his latest mission, reports Variety.. While she admits that she's nervous about her big move, Deepika also talks about her Hollywood debut being a proud moment: ""I feel proud to be a part of a film where I get to flaunt my ethnicity,"" she said to Filmfare. ""The reason they are roping me is because of my ethnicity. I really hope that I do well in the movie and people go and watch it. "". Deepika announced the news of her casting last month via an ambiguous photo with Vin Diesel, which also led to a rather hilarious spoof.. Directed by DJ Caruso, the action-packed thriller also stars Samuel L Jackson, Ruby Rose, Nina Dobrev and Jet Li.. Comments. Popular. Latest. Muhammad Majid Jan 22, 2016 03:15pm. Awaited,. Recommend. Satt Jan 22, 2016 03:28pm. This is racism..nobody should give role because he or she is of certain race or ethnicity and worse that you are flaunting that race and ethnicity.As an protest I will never watch this film.. Recommend. Dipak Singh Jan 22, 2016 03:57pm. Why always became news if anybody makes Hollywood debut?? Its an only job like lots of people getting jobs in overseas, that's it.. Recommend. yaha haha Jan 22, 2016 04:36pm. @Satt Get real.....This is Business first, plays trying to capturing the most audiences. Should not be labelled into race. Recommend. MS Jan 22, 2016 05:02pm. @Satt ,unsure how you think of this as a racist scenario. If a role demands a person to be from a certain ethnicity, then that's how it is going to be portrayed on the big screen!. Recommend. Jamboree Jan 22, 2016 06:11pm. Great! Deepika rocks.. Recommend. Historicevents Jan 22, 2016 06:15pm. While appreciating and congrats for such a project,Deepeka will surely be critized for flaunt displays by Indians.Although the Indian viewers pardon flaunts at Bollywood but it will be difficult to see their actress with alien Vin Diesel.And if if God forbid Deepeka appears to be extra bold flaunts,than must be prepared to face protests in India as well as slogans against her, because in India people are very much race,religion,caste,ethnic conxious.. Recommend. Satt Jan 22, 2016 07:26pm. @Historicevents You have never watched all the Indian cinema,flaunting and showing body in India is doesn't consider bad but flaunting wrong thing does,here in interview she said she will flaunt her ethnicity and race and this is not acceptable in India.You can show your beauty but can't say that I am beautiful because I am of certain race and ethnicity,In Indian culture every race and every ethnicity is beautiful.. Recommend. KN Jan 22, 2016 07:42pm. India is a huge lucrative market which every body is after including Hollywood. Recommend. WaheedNoor Jan 22, 2016 08:02pm. Great.. Recommend.

Fawad Jan 22, 2016 09:49pm. @Satt she is playing role of an indian, you want Americans to play role of Indian or want Africans to play role of some white guy, how can you justify that?. Recommend. Sami Jan 22, 2016 10:11pm. @Satt Relax man! She is proud of her ethnicity and she is speaking how she feels, from her heart. She isn't saying one ethnic group is better or less than another!. Recommend. Tamilselvan Jan 22, 2016 10:44pm. This is called tokenism part to get viewers in South Asia!. Recommend. Changez_Khan Jan 22, 2016 10:58pm. It is pretty obvious Hollywood is hungry for marketing and what better place is then India, they give role to leading Indian actor/actress to gain the market share, just imagine over billion people industry.

While news of deficits, tax packages, currency devaluation, and the like capture the business headlines, is there any doubt that far more people in our nation are interested and intrigued by what is going on with the Madoff scam? I have no doubt.. I have very mixed feelings about Irving Picard, the trustee assigned to recover funds for those victimized by Madoff‚Äôs Ponzi scam, going after Wall Street institutions and foreign banks who knew or should have known of Madoff‚Äôs operation. Mixed feelings? Am I going soft? Shouldn‚Äôt these institutions be held to account? Let‚Äôs navigate. (more‚Ä¶).

Packin‚Äô the bags...again and again and again! I‚Äôve packed so many bags for my family you would think I was a professional packer--backpacks, lunch packs, book bags, purses, suitcases, camp trunks, laundry bags, trash bags, brown bags, designer bags, big bags, small bags-- you name it...I‚Äôve packed it! Way more than once!. But the question is...have I packed the MOST IMPORTANT BAG OF ALL?. Have I packed The Spiritual Bag?. What are the ‚ÄúSPIRITUAL ESSENTIALS‚Äù that need to be packed up --the things I really need to ensure that my family and I are equipped to handle life, come what may?. Here are the top three you will never want to leave home without.*. 1. A personal relationship with Christ. How does this happen?. Read the Bible. The Bible is the best way to get to know who God is. He tells us who He is in His Word. Want to know God better? Get to know Jesus. He is the ‚Äúspitting image‚Äù of His Father (Hebrews 1:3). Do you have a good story book Bible for bedtime reading with the kids? Reward them for memorizing Bible verses! It works! (see last week‚Äôs blog for easy to memorize verses.). Watch Christian videos:. For kids:. Veggie Tales SuperBook For adults- The Bible, Fr. Robert Barron and other Scripture based media.. Listen to:. For kids:. ‚ÄúHide ‚ÄòEm in Your Heart Bible Songs‚Äù, in your car. Adults- 91.1 FM WGTS. Pray before meals together, before bedtime, or bless them going out the door! Pray ANYTIME! Ask them, ‚ÄúHow can I pray for you?‚Äù and PRAY for them right then and there! There is nothing like talking to God together spontaneously to teach the kids to KNOW He is real and available for them ANYTIME.. Go to Mass together. Take the Sacraments. Do Adoration and go to Confession as a family. These ‚Äútools of the Christian Life‚Äù help get us through the good and not so good times and bond us closer to God and each other.. 2. The knowledge that you are infinitely loved by God and that He has prepared a place for you when this life is over. If we learn early on that we are truly valued and loved by God, so much so that He died and rose again and is seated at the right hand of the Father praying for us in heaven, then we have a direction in which to point our life. We are made for heaven. We are intended to be with Him there. Our job is to love God first and foremost and to help our family and friends to get to heaven, experience union with God. Your kids need to know that there is more to life than what they see. When times get tough, thoughts of eternity can keep us going because our reward awaits us. And in heaven, we'll experience intimacy, beauty, adventure and peace.. 3. The gift of understanding that you have a mission from God that is unique and purposeful. We need to ask ourselves and ask our kids, ‚ÄùWhat good thing did God create for me/you to do?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat good do you think God wants to bring into this world through me/you?‚Äù We are not here for our own glory, but for the glory and purpose of God. When we realize God has a mission for us, we find purpose in everything we do.. Reading the stories of the Saints Lives can be very helpful and inspiring. They were all very human, but God did great things in and through them. He can and will do the same in us if we allow Him.. You are your child‚Äôs best teacher. Lead through example.. Ask God if He would like to pack YOUR bag with any new equipment over Lent. Perhaps He is asking you to explore your faith more deeply through an ALPHA Course or a Bible Study like Walking with Purpose.. Life is a journey... better get packin‚Äô!. Train the young in the way they should go; even when old, they will not swerve from it. Proverbs 22:6. Dear Lord, What a job! You have given me the task of preparing my children spiritually to face the world! I realize that sending them to Catholic or Christian Schools is not enough. I need to pour Your love and truth into them everyday! Lord, fill me up! Cover my lack with

Hey guys.. I've just been playing the new bloodbowl PC game and loved it. What I was wondering was how many of the club members have this game, or are going to get it (pc version).. Do we have enough to start a league for the club.. Cheers,. Shags. Shags. cleverfellow. Global Moderator. Posts: 376. How many club members have bloodbowl pc Jul 30, 2009 20:14:35 GMT 10. Quote.

I will most likely pick the game up later this year - there's a few miniatures I would like to buy first, then I'll grab a copy.. Online turn-based league sounds good to me.. bensmall. Gamer.

Post by bensmall on Aug 12, 2009 13:36:08 GMT 10. I'm definitely interested in this, but we can already do this for free with the site:. www.fumbbl.com. The only problem with it is its on LRB4 rules, but I'd prefer that with more of us in, than only 3 of us buying the PC game. Is the PC game on LRB5 rules? How much does it cost?. cleverfellow.

Post by cleverfellow on Aug 12, 2009 20:15:04 GMT 10. I honestly don't know what the ruleset is, but the game is USD49, so the actual cost fluctuates with the exchange rate... you can't buy it in stores at the moment.. shags. Global Moderator.

I prefer fumbbl with all the races, but I'd be keen to play this version if people happy to play over hamachi.. Last Edit: Oct 13, 2009 7:50:01 GMT 10 by shags. Reply.
